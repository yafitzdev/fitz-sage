# CLI Reference

The CLI is intentionally small: one command for the normal retrieval workflow,
one command for explicit answer synthesis, and a few operational commands.

```bash
fitz --help
fitz <command> --help
```

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# From inside a document folder: register the current directory and return evidence
fitz retrieve "Which documents are relevant to the refund policy?"

# Point at a different source folder
fitz retrieve "Which documents are relevant to the refund policy?" --source ./docs

# Advanced evidence controls
fitz retrieve "Which documents are relevant?" --source ./docs --top-k 8
fitz retrieve "Which documents are relevant?" --source ./docs --format json

# Optional generated answer, only when you explicitly provide a synthesizer
fitz answer "What is the refund policy?" --source ./docs \
  --endpoint http://localhost:8080/v1 \
  --synthesizer endpoint/qwen2.5-7b-instruct
```

`fitz retrieve` is the product default. It returns a ranked `EvidencePack`; it
does not generate an answer. Query-time semantic terms, reranking, and Pyrrho
run locally on CPU, so no API key or external inference server is needed.
Optional background entity and hierarchy work may continue afterward.

---

## Commands

The public commands are `retrieve`, `explain`, `replay`, `answer`,
`collections`, and `serve`.
Configuration is auto-created on first run; there is no separate init or ingest
step.

### `fitz retrieve`

Return governed evidence. If neither `--source` nor
`--collection` is provided, `fitz retrieve` uses the current working directory as
the source and derives the collection name from that folder.

```bash
fitz retrieve "Your question"
fitz retrieve "Your question" --source ./docs
fitz retrieve "Your question" --collection product_docs
fitz retrieve "Your question" --source ./docs --collection product_docs
```

**Arguments**
- `QUESTION` - the question to retrieve evidence for

**Options**
- `-s, --source PATH` - file or directory to register before retrieval
- `-c, --collection TEXT` - collection name; defaults to the source folder name
- `-e, --engine TEXT` - engine name; defaults to `fitz_krag`
- `--format text|json` - human-readable table or serialized `EvidencePack`
- `--top-k INT` - maximum evidence items to show
- `--trace PATH` - write a versioned retrieval execution record
- `--trace-content` - include source content so Pyrrho can be replayed;
  requires `--trace`

**What the user sees**

1. A short progress feed: source discovery, indexing, query analysis, and
   retrieval.
2. A ranked evidence table.
3. Pyrrho's verdict, probabilities, reasons, and progressive delivery counts.
4. An enrichment status line when optional entity/hierarchy work is running.

If enrichment is still pending after the first evidence pack is shown, the CLI
starts a detached `enrichment-daemon` process so the collection keeps improving
after the foreground command exits.

Trace capture and the displayed `EvidencePack` come from one execution. Source
content is redacted unless `--trace-content` is explicitly set.

### `fitz explain`

Explain a retrieval trace without loading a collection or rerunning models.

```bash
fitz explain run.json
```

### `fitz replay`

Replay only Pyrrho over verified, frozen evidence. The input must have been
captured with `--trace-content`.

```bash
fitz replay run-with-content.json
fitz replay run-with-content.json \
  --pyrrho pyrrho/C:/models/pyrrho-candidate \
  --output replay.json
fitz replay run-with-content.json --format json
```

**Options**
- `--pyrrho TEXT` - provider/model spec; defaults to the recorded one
- `-o, --output PATH` - write a versioned Pyrrho replay record
- `--format text|json` - human explanation or serialized replay
- `--include-content` - include selected source content in JSON output

Replay does not rerun BM25, semantic keywords, reranking, or compilation. See
[Retrieval Execution Records](RETRIEVAL_RUNS.md) for the exact boundary and
redaction policy.

### `fitz answer`

Generate an optional synthesized answer from retrieved evidence. This is not the
default retrieval surface. It requires a configured `synthesizer:` provider or
CLI synthesis flags.

```bash
fitz answer "Your question" --source ./docs \
  --synthesizer openai/gpt-4o

fitz answer "Your question" --source ./docs \
  --endpoint http://localhost:8080/v1 \
  --synthesizer endpoint/qwen2.5-7b-instruct

fitz answer "Your question" -c my_collection \
  --synthesizer openai/gpt-4o
```

If no synthesizer is configured, the command fails with an actionable error and
points you back to evidence retrieval.

**Options**
- `-s, --source PATH` - register documents before answering
- `-c, --collection TEXT` - collection name
- `-e, --engine TEXT` - engine name
- `--synthesizer TEXT` - provider/model spec for synthesis
- `--endpoint TEXT` - OpenAI-compatible URL; pairs with `--model` or
  `--synthesizer endpoint/<model>`
- `-m, --model TEXT` - chat model name sent to the endpoint
- `--api-key-env TEXT` - env var holding the API key

### `fitz collections`

Manage collections.

```bash
fitz collections          # interactive menu
```

The menu lists, inspects, and deletes collections. A collection is a single
SQLite database plus manifest state under the Fitz workspace. Deleting one
removes the database, SQLite sidecars, and collection manifest directory.

### `fitz serve`

Start the REST API server.

```bash
fitz serve
FITZ_API_KEY=secret fitz serve --host 0.0.0.0 -p 8080
fitz serve --reload
```

**Options**
- `-h, --host TEXT` - bind host; default `127.0.0.1`
- `-p, --port INT` - bind port; default `8000`
- `--reload` - auto-reload on code change

Non-loopback binding requires `FITZ_API_KEY`; remote clients send it as
`X-Fitz-API-Key`. Browser CORS and server-local source roots are disabled or
restricted by default; see [API.md](API.md).

See [API.md](API.md) for endpoint schemas.

---

## Configuration

The minimum on-disk config (`.fitz/config.yaml` in the current workspace) is:

```yaml
collection: default
parser: cpu
rerank: onnx
governance: pyrrho
query_intelligence: null
synthesizer: null
chat_base_url: http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1
```

This is enough for `fitz retrieve` and `fitz_sage.evidence(...)`. SQLite
semantic query expansion, the ONNX reranker, and the accepted Pyrrho default
run locally on CPU. Background entity and hierarchy enrichment requires a
configured chat tier and is independent of source-index readiness.

See [CONFIG.md](CONFIG.md) for every key and
[CONFIG_EXAMPLES.md](CONFIG_EXAMPLES.md) for deployment examples.

---

## Environment Variables

API keys are needed only for optional endpoint-backed roles such as answer
synthesis, query intelligence, or vision parsing. The CLI looks up the variable
name from `chat_api_key_env` or from the `--api-key-env` flag.

```bash
# OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY="..."

# Together / Groq / Mistral
export TOGETHER_API_KEY="..."
```

Run the command from a different working directory to use a separate workspace.
`FITZ_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` enables verbose logging for any command.
