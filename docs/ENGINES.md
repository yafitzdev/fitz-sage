# Engines

The base engine protocol still supports `answer(Query) -> Answer`, but the
production `fitz_krag` engine is
retrieval-first: use `evidence(Query) -> EvidencePack` when you want the
ranked source material without generation.

The shipping engine is `fitz_krag` (Knowledge Routing Augmented
Generation). It's the only one most users need.

## Core Contracts

Defined in `fitz_sage/core/`:

### `KnowledgeEngine`

```python
from typing import Protocol
from fitz_sage.core import Query, Answer

class KnowledgeEngine(Protocol):
    def answer(self, query: Query) -> Answer: ...
```

### `Query`

```python
@dataclass
class Query:
    text: str
    metadata: dict = field(default_factory=dict)
```

### `Answer`

```python
@dataclass
class Answer:
    text: str
    mode: AnswerMode | None           # runtime: SUFFICIENT | DISPUTED | INSUFFICIENT
    provenance: list[Provenance]
    metadata: dict
```

### `Provenance`

```python
@dataclass
class Provenance:
    source_id: str        # stable engine-specific source identifier
    excerpt: str | None
    metadata: dict
```

## `fitz_krag` — the production engine

**Location:** `fitz_sage/engines/fitz_krag/`

KRAG is a structure-first retriever. Instead of chunking documents into
fixed-size text windows and embedding them, it parses code, prose, and
tables into typed units (`Symbol`, `Section`, `TableSpec`) and routes
queries to the right strategy.

```
Query
 ├─► Query prep (deterministic signals, explicit clauses, corpus term graph)
 ├─► Router (symbol search · section search · table metadata)
│    └─► FTS5 + bm25() over per-collection .db
 ├─► OnnxReranker (bounded INT8 ONNX cross-encoder)
 ├─► Read + bounded evidence closure + compilation
 ├─► Progressive Pyrrho prefixes (3, then +2 while INSUFFICIENT)
 ├─► EvidencePack
 └─► Optional synthesizer → Answer (+ provenance + mode)
```

### Usage

```python
from pathlib import Path

from fitz_sage.core import Query
from fitz_sage.engines.fitz_krag.config.schema import FitzKragConfig
from fitz_sage.engines.fitz_krag.engine import FitzKragEngine

cfg = FitzKragConfig(
    collection="my_docs",
)
engine = FitzKragEngine(cfg)
engine.point(Path("./docs"), start_worker=False)
pack = engine.evidence(Query(text="What is X?"))
```

### Retrieval-first evidence

`evidence()` returns the governed, serializable evidence pack. This is the
contract used by `fitz retrieve`:

```python
pack = engine.evidence(Query(text="Where is auth handled?"))
for item in pack.items:
    print(item.file_path, item.excerpt)
```

For raw engine-specific source objects without governance packaging, call
`retrieve()`:

```python
results = engine.retrieve(Query(text="Where is auth handled?"))
for r in results:                       # list[ReadResult]
    print(r.file_path, r.content)
```

`retrieve()` returns `ReadResult`s (`file_path`, `content`, and an `Address`
with provenance and score), skipping evidence packaging and optional synthesis.

### Configuration

See [CONFIG.md](CONFIG.md) for every key. The minimum is `collection:`.
Chat providers are optional and only needed for synthesized answers, background
enrichment, or vision parsing. Semantic query terms come from the collection
database. Conversational and ambiguous queries must be rewritten by the caller.

### Built-in features

| Feature                 | What it does                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Symbol / section / table routing | Per-content-type retrieval strategies              |
| Import graph traversal  | Code: walks references and imports across files               |
| Entity linking          | Cross-source linking via shared named entities                |
| Hierarchical summaries  | L1 file summaries and L2 corpus overview built during enrichment |
| Evidence closure        | Bounded bridge retrieval for unresolved query obligations      |
| ONNX reranker           | Bounded INT8 cross-encoder, two batch-one CPU workers          |
| Epistemic governance    | Pyrrho v2 sufficient / disputed / insufficient evidence verdicts |
| Source indexing         | Parse and persist before `point()` returns; enrich afterward |

## Engine selection

The default engine is `fitz_krag`. Choose another via the runtime API
or the CLI:

```python
from fitz_sage import run

# run() calls answer(), so fitz_krag requires a configured synthesizer here.
answer = run("What is X?", engine="fitz_krag")
```

```bash
fitz retrieve "What is X?" --engine fitz_krag --source ./docs
```

### Available engines

| Engine     | Status     | Description                                         |
| ---------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `fitz_krag`| Production | KRAG with epistemic guardrails (this doc's subject) |

Custom engines register through the engine registry — see
[CUSTOM_ENGINES.md](CUSTOM_ENGINES.md).

## Custom engines

```python
from fitz_sage.core import Answer, Query
from fitz_sage.core.answer_mode import AnswerMode
from fitz_sage.runtime import EngineRegistry

class MyEngine:
    def answer(self, query: Query) -> Answer:
        return Answer(
            text="...",
            mode=AnswerMode.SUFFICIENT,  # runtime mode for sufficient evidence
            provenance=[],
            metadata={},
        )

EngineRegistry.get_global().register("my_engine", lambda config: MyEngine())
```

You don't need to subclass anything — duck-typing on the protocol is
enough. See [CUSTOM_ENGINES.md](CUSTOM_ENGINES.md) for the registry and
config-loader hooks.

## Architecture principles

1. **Protocol over inheritance.** Implement `KnowledgeEngine` by
   exposing a single `answer()` method.
2. **Config-driven.** Engine behaviour lives in YAML / `*Config`
   dataclasses, not in Python keywords.
3. **Optional shared infrastructure.** Engines may reuse Fitz-Sage chat,
   storage, and ingestion modules, but the core protocol does not require them.
4. **Honest evidence.** Every `EvidencePack` carries a `mode`; optional
   answers inherit that epistemic posture.
