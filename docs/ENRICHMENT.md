# Background Enrichment

Enrichment improves an already-searchable collection. It is not indexing and it
is not a prerequisite for retrieval.

## Ownership

Foreground indexing owns:

- parsing source files;
- storing raw source, sections, symbols, tables, and FTS5 rows;
- deterministic code-import resolution.

Background enrichment owns:

- entity and temporal metadata extraction;
- entity-graph population;
- per-file hierarchy summaries;
- the corpus hierarchy summary;
- summaries generated on demand for queried files.

Fitz-Sage does not use enrichment to normalize source identifiers, repair
abbreviations, rewrite logs, compress documents, or infer that differently
spelled values are equivalent. Document preparation and domain mapping remain
user-owned.

## State Machine

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> PENDING: source indexed
    PENDING --> ENTITY_LINKED: entity step succeeds
    ENTITY_LINKED --> COMPLETE: file hierarchy succeeds
    COMPLETE --> SUMMARIZED: queried file is warmed
    PENDING --> FAILED: entity step fails
    ENTITY_LINKED --> FAILED: hierarchy step fails
    FAILED --> PENDING: retry entity step
    FAILED --> ENTITY_LINKED: retry hierarchy step
```

The file remains `INDEXED` through every enrichment transition. Collection
hierarchy finalization has its own `PENDING`, `COMPLETE`, or `FAILED` state.

## Scheduling

`BackgroundEnrichmentWorker` processes smaller and higher-priority files first.
Files returned by a query move to priority 1; their directory siblings move to
priority 2. The worker pauses before model work while a query is active.

The in-process worker begins after `point()` returns. A short-lived CLI process
stops that thread and launches the hidden `enrichment-daemon` when work remains.
The manifest is written atomically so the query process and detached process
never observe partial JSON.

## Failure Behavior

Per-file model errors are recorded under `enrichment.failed_files`. They do not
change source-index health and do not delete searchable data. A later
`continue_enrichment()` retries from the last durable stage.

Use:

```python
engine.continue_enrichment()   # synchronous completion attempt
engine.wait_for_enrichment()   # wait for the current in-process worker
engine.stop_background_enrichment()
```

## Optional Chat Work

Entity extraction and hierarchy summaries run only when a balanced chat tier is
configured. Without one, `point()` marks background enrichment not applicable;
the source and its collection-derived semantic term graph are already
searchable.

Semantic query expansion is independent of background enrichment. Foreground
ingestion records deterministic term evidence in SQLite, and query-time graph
lookup remains local and model-free.

## Demand Summaries

Source sections are rerankable before summaries exist because retrieval supplies
a bounded source excerpt. Once a query surfaces a file, the warm loop may
generate and persist its summary. Unqueried files are not summarized eagerly.
