# Retrieval Execution Records

`RetrievalRun` is the versioned audit record for one governed retrieval. It
captures what Fitz actually did, not a second diagnostic execution.

The record is useful for:

- explaining why a query produced a particular `EvidencePack`;
- comparing query planning, candidates, and Pyrrho decisions across releases;
- preserving the exact Pyrrho input for later evaluation;
- debugging production failures without adding hidden data normalization.

## Capture

### CLI

```bash
# Source bodies are redacted by default.
fitz retrieve "Which test failed?" -c reports --trace run.json

# Required when the trace will be used for Pyrrho replay.
fitz retrieve "Which test failed?" -c reports \
  --trace run-with-content.json \
  --trace-content
```

`--trace` and normal evidence output come from the same pipeline execution.
Fitz does not retrieve twice.

### SDK

```python
from fitz_sage import trace

run = trace("Which test failed?", collection="reports")
run.write("run.json")  # redacted
run.write("run-with-content.json", include_content=True)
```

The stateful SDK exposes the same operation:

```python
from fitz_sage import fitz

f = fitz(collection="reports")
run = f.trace("Which test failed?")
```

## Inspect

```bash
fitz explain run.json
```

`explain` reads the record and renders a deterministic summary. It does not
load the collection, call a model, or rerun retrieval.

Programmatically:

```python
from fitz_sage import RetrievalRun

run = RetrievalRun.read("run.json")
print(run.explain())
```

## Recorded Stages

A version 2 record contains:

- original, sanitized, and effective retrieval queries;
- query shape and stable planning fields;
- retrieval terms with `literal`, `deterministic`, or `semantic` origin;
- retrieval strategy calls and result counts;
- ordered candidate identities and scores at recall, rerank, and final stages;
- the complete ranked evidence after evidence compilation;
- the exact stopping prefix selected by progressive Pyrrho delivery;
- the selected `EvidencePack`;
- Pyrrho's exact serialized verdict, heads, probabilities, token counts,
  truncation status, and model identity;
- Fitz, engine, collection, component, config-hash, collection-fingerprint, and
  indexing-state metadata.

The collection fingerprint hashes the collection manifest and recorded
indexing status. It is a change detector, not a byte-for-byte snapshot of the
SQLite indexes.

## Redaction

`RetrievalRun.to_dict()`, `to_json()`, and `write()` redact source content by
default. Redacted output removes:

- selected evidence content and excerpts;
- frozen ranked-evidence content and address summaries;
- source-derived item metadata;
- the retrieval trace and other pack metadata represented by typed run fields.

It retains the query, generated terms, source IDs, file paths, structural
locations, scores, hashes, and governance output. A redacted trace is therefore
content-free, but it is not anonymous. Treat query and path metadata according
to your environment's data policy.

`include_content=True` includes the complete compiled evidence and must be
handled like the source documents themselves. Content-bearing records include
SHA-256 digests and character counts. Loading rejects changed frozen evidence.

## Pyrrho Replay

Pyrrho replay asks the configured Pyrrho model to evaluate the exact delivered evidence
stored in a content-bearing trace:

```bash
# Use the provider recorded in the trace.
fitz replay run-with-content.json

# Evaluate a different accepted package.
fitz replay run-with-content.json \
  --pyrrho pyrrho/C:/models/pyrrho-candidate \
  --output replay.json
```

```python
from fitz_sage import replay_pyrrho

result = replay_pyrrho(
    "run-with-content.json",
    pyrrho="pyrrho/C:/models/pyrrho-candidate",
)
print(result.explain())
```

Replay performs one Pyrrho call over the recorded final `pyrrho_evidence`
stopping prefix. It does not replay earlier prefix decisions or rerun query
preparation, BM25, semantic keyword generation, retrieval, reranking, evidence
closure, or compilation. This boundary is deliberate: replay answers "Would
this Pyrrho package judge the same frozen evidence differently?", not "Would
the current system retrieve the same evidence?"

Replay records both the source and current Fitz versions, but Fitz-Sage does
not reinterpret the result. Pyrrho replay currently supports `fitz_krag`
records only.

Redacted traces cannot be replayed. Fitz fails explicitly instead of fetching
current source content, because doing so would no longer be a frozen-evidence
experiment.

## Versioning

The top-level `schema_version` currently uses major version `2`. Readers accept
minor additions within the same major version and ignore unknown fields. They
reject unsupported major versions rather than guessing at changed semantics.

Both `RetrievalRun` and `PyrrhoReplay` support `to_dict`, `to_json`,
`write`, `from_dict`, `from_json`, and `read`.
