# Configuration Reference

Engine config lives at `.fitz/config.yaml` in the current workspace
(auto-created on first run). Storage lives at
`.fitz/sqlite/fitz_<collection>.db` (auto-created on first ingest).

Explicit collection names must match `[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]{0,63}`. They are
validated, not normalized: `project-a` and `project_a` are separate
collections. Names derived by the CLI from source directories are slugged only
at that explicit boundary.

---

## Minimal config

```yaml
# .fitz/config.yaml
collection: default
parser: cpu
rerank: onnx
governance: pyrrho
synthesizer: null
chat_base_url: http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1
```

This is enough for `fitz retrieve` and `fitz_sage.evidence(...)`.
No hosted API key or external inference server is required.
For exact local model IDs, runtimes, cache locations, and the smoke command,
see [Managed Models](MANAGED_MODELS.md).

To enable synthesized answers through a hosted endpoint:

```yaml
synthesizer: endpoint/gpt-4o
chat_base_url: https://api.openai.com/v1
chat_api_key_env: OPENAI_API_KEY
collection: default
```

Or pass the provider per invocation:

```bash
fitz answer "What is X?" --synthesizer openai/gpt-4o
```

## LLM Providers

Role-specific provider fields bind LLM-backed stages:

| Key                  | Typical use                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `synthesizer`        | Optional answer generation                       |

Default semantic query keywords come from the collection's SQLite term graph.
Optional background entity, hierarchy, and demand-summary work uses a
configured balanced chat tier after the source index is searchable. Optional
endpoint-backed roles take a provider/model spec. For
`endpoint`, the model name is the part after the slash and `chat_base_url`
supplies the OpenAI-compatible URL:

```yaml
synthesizer: endpoint/qwen2.5-32b
chat_base_url: http://localhost:8080/v1
```

If `chat_base_url` is shared across roles (the common case), set it once at
the top level. `chat_fast`, `chat_balanced`, and `chat_smart` are optional
low-level tier slots. Configuring any tier also enables optional model-backed
table SQL and structural code-search enhancements; deterministic table and code
retrieval remains available without them.

---

## Chat provider model

Semantic query expansion is model-free. Optional synthesis, background
enrichment, and vision can use **`endpoint`** or the
cloud/enterprise presets:

| Spec form                       | Resolves to                                              |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `endpoint/<model>` + `chat_base_url` | canonical custom endpoint form                       |
| `openai/<model>`                | endpoint pointing at `https://api.openai.com/v1`         |
| `azure_openai/<deployment>`     | endpoint with Azure deployment URL                       |
| `enterprise/<provider>/<model>` | endpoint + M2M / mTLS / custom-CA auth                   |

Provider specs must resolve to the OpenAI-compatible chat protocol.
For local servers such as Ollama, use `endpoint` with the server's
`/v1` URL, for example `http://localhost:11434/v1`.

---

## Feature control

The retrieval backbone includes collection-derived semantic query terms, the
ONNX reranker, and Pyrrho governance.
Optional endpoint-backed features are switched on by **provider presence**,
not boolean flags:

| Feature            | Standard / enabled when                  | Disabled when                       |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Semantic query terms | SQLite term-graph lookup on each standard query | no public off switch in product config |
| Background enrichment | starts after source indexing when a chat tier is configured | not applicable without a chat tier |
| ONNX reranker      | `rerank: onnx` (default)                 | not disabled                        |
| Governance         | `governance: pyrrho` uses the accepted pinned model; custom model optional | not disabled |
| Answer synthesis   | `synthesizer: <provider/model>`          | `synthesizer: null`                 |
| VLM in parser      | `parser: docling_vision` + `vision:` set | `parser: cpu`, `parser: docling`, or `parser: glm_ocr` |

---

## Storage

```yaml
collection: default          # active collection
```

That's the entire storage surface. SQLite + FTS5 + WAL, one `.db` per
collection. Storage paths are derived automatically — one
`fitz_<collection>.db` under the workspace `sqlite/` directory; there
is no settable storage-path config key.
See [features/platform/unified-storage.md](features/platform/unified-storage.md)
for the schema and pragmas.

---

## Parser

```yaml
parser: cpu                # CPU pypdfium2 text-layer parser (default)
# parser: docling          # Docling structure extraction
# parser: docling_vision   # Docling + VLM for figure descriptions
# parser: glm_ocr          # hybrid pdfplumber + GLM-OCR, handles scanned pages
```

| Parser | Primary contract | Install |
|---|---|---|
| `cpu` | embedded text from supported rich documents | base install |
| `docling` | explicit Docling structure extraction | `pip install fitz-sage[docs]` |
| `docling_vision` | Docling plus a configured vision provider | `[docs]` + `vision:` |
| `glm_ocr` | pdfplumber text path plus GLM-OCR fallback for scans | base install plus local Ollama `glm-ocr` model |

Only `cpu`, `docling`, `docling_vision`, and `glm_ocr` are selectable
`parser:` values. `lightweight` is an automatic ImportError fallback (not
selectable), and plain-text / CSV files are routed by extension to
built-in plugins — they are not `parser:` options.

---

## Authentication

API keys are needed only for hosted providers. They are read from
environment variables — never put them in the config file. Name the env var with
`chat_api_key_env`:

```yaml
chat_api_key_env: OPENAI_API_KEY
```

| Service          | Common env var       |
| ---------------- | -------------------- |
| OpenAI           | `OPENAI_API_KEY`     |
| Together         | `TOGETHER_API_KEY`   |
| Groq             | `GROQ_API_KEY`       |
| Mistral La Plateforme | `MISTRAL_API_KEY` |
| Local endpoint server / LM Studio / Ollama | (no key) |

For enterprise (M2M / mTLS) deployments see
[features/platform/enterprise-gateway.md](features/platform/enterprise-gateway.md).

---

## Retrieval knobs

```yaml
top_addresses: 50      # candidates fetched during broad recall
top_read: 50           # candidates read after rerank
rerank_candidates: 32  # moderate-query cross-encoder budget (24/32/48)
retrieval_workers: 4   # max retrieval strategies run concurrently
governance: pyrrho
rerank: onnx
```

Query preparation is deterministic. The planner detects supported query shapes,
uses explicit clauses from the submitted query, and adds collection-derived
terms from the SQLite graph. Conversational or ambiguous queries must be
rewritten by the caller before retrieval.

---

## Synthesis Knobs

```yaml
synthesizer: openai/gpt-4o
max_answer_tokens: 512       # general answer cap
short_answer_tokens: 192     # factual-question cap
strict_grounding: true
```

The optional synthesizer prompt is concise by default. For narrow factual
questions, fitz-sage uses the smaller `short_answer_tokens` cap so small local
models do not spend most of the query time writing long prose.

---

## Per-invocation overrides

The CLI accepts overrides without editing the config file:

```bash
fitz answer "What is X?" \
  --endpoint https://api.together.xyz/v1 \
  --synthesizer endpoint/meta-llama-3.1-70b \
  --api-key-env TOGETHER_API_KEY
```

`fitz answer` uses these flags to configure the synthesizer for that invocation.
`fitz retrieve` ignores synthesis override flags because it does
not synthesize.
