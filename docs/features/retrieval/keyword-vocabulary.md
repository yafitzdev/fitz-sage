# Literal Identifier Search

Identifiers such as test IDs, tickets, error codes, versions, and function names
are stored from source text without rewriting.

## Source Contract

Fitz-Sage does not silently declare separator variants equivalent:

- `TC-1001`
- `TC_1001`
- `TC 1001`
- `TC1001`

If those values mean the same thing in a user's domain, the user must normalize
the source/query or provide explicit alias evidence. See
[Limitations](../../LIMITATIONS.md).

## Retrieval Path

```text
source text and typed units
    -> SQLite FTS5 index
query literal and semantic terms
    -> FTS5 MATCH + bm25()
    -> ONNX cross-encoder reranking
```

There is no ingestion-time keyword column, fixed synonym dictionary,
identifier-normalization pass, or alternate vocabulary store. Code retrieval
also searches extracted symbol names and qualified names.

SQLite tokenization can surface lexical neighbors. For example, punctuation may
split a value into component tokens. A retrieved neighbor is a candidate, not a
claim that two identifiers are equivalent. The reranker and Pyrrho see the raw
source form.

## Query-Time Expansion

The recall query may contain:

- literal terms from the original query;
- semantic keywords derived from the collection's SQLite term graph;
- no implicit alias or mapping terms.

There is no public mapping-term API. Semantic terms are search suggestions.
They do not rewrite stored data and do not prove equivalence.

## Why No Automatic Cleanup

Identifier conventions are domain-specific. Treating punctuation variants as
aliases may improve one corpus and create false matches in another. Fitz-Sage
therefore keeps document cleanup and authoritative mappings outside the
universal package core.
