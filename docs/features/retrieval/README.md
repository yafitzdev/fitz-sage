# docs/features/retrieval/

Deep-dive documentation for fitz-sage's retrieval intelligence modules. The
standard pipeline is broad recall → ONNX rerank → one configured local Pyrrho decision. See
[Three-Stage Retrieval Strategy](three-stage-strategy.md) for the product model
and [Retrieval Pipeline](../../RETRIEVAL_PIPELINE.md) for the end-to-end flow.
