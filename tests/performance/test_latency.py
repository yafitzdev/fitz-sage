"""
Performance tests for the pipeline harness — NOT LLM speed.

Tests here measure overhead added by fitz-ai's pipeline around LLM calls:
routing, retrieval, context assembly, memory stability. They mock LLM calls
to isolate harness performance from hardware-dependent generation speed.

Run with: pytest tests/performance/ -v -s --tb=short
