Fitz is a **knowledge access platform** for teams that need reliable, configurable retrieval **today**, without locking themselves into a single reasoning paradigm **tomorrow**.

You ingest your knowledge once. How it gets queried can evolve.

---

## 🤔 Why Fitz Exists

Organizations repeatedly rebuild the same systems: ingest documents, chunk them, embed them, retrieve them, generate answers. Every time the reasoning method changes, everything breaks.

**The insight:** Reasoning methods evolve faster than knowledge.

- RAG today
- Compression-native models tomorrow
- Something else after that

But the knowledge layer remains.

Most RAG tools optimize *one method*. Fitz stabilizes the **knowledge layer itself**.

---

## 🧠 The Mental Model

```
  Your Knowledge
      ↓
  Fitz (Knowledge Access Layer)
      ↓
  Engines (replaceable)
      ↓
  Answer
```

**What stays stable:** Ingested documents, chunking decisions, metadata, provenance, API contracts.

**What can change:** Retrieval strategies, reasoning methods, model providers, compression techniques.

You optimize for **stability where it matters** and **flexibility where change is inevitable**.

## ⚖️ How Fitz Is Different

This isn't a critique of other tools. It's a design difference.

| | LangChain & Similar | Fitz |
|---|---------------------|------|
| **Optimizes for** | Flows & prompt chains | Knowledge stability |
| **Assumes** | Rapid experimentation | Systems live for years |
| **Switching paradigms** | Often means refactoring | Means changing engines |
| **Best for** | Exploring ideas | Building infrastructure |

If you're exploring ideas, LangChain is excellent. If you're building infrastructure that will outlive your current model choices, Fitz is designed for that.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
pip install fitz
```

```python
from fitz.engines.classic_rag import run_classic_rag

answer = run_classic_rag("What does our contract say about termination?")
print(answer.text)
```

That's it. Classic RAG works out of the box.

---

## ⚙️ Engines

Engines encapsulate *how* knowledge is queried. They're not plugins. They're paradigms.

### Classic RAG (Default) ✅

Production-ready retrieval-augmented generation.

```python
from fitz.engines.classic_rag import run_classic_rag

answer = run_classic_rag("What is our refund policy?")

for source in answer.provenance:
    print(f"{source.source_id}: {source.excerpt}")
```

### CLaRa (Experimental) 🧪

Compression-native reasoning for large document collections. 16x to 128x compression with unified retrieval and generation.

```python
from fitz.engines.clara import create_clara_engine

engine = create_clara_engine()
engine.add_documents(my_documents)
answer = engine.answer(Query(text="What patterns emerge across these reports?"))
```

> Engines are interchangeable. Your knowledge is not.

## ✅ When Fitz Makes Sense

- Internal company knowledge bases
- Compliance-sensitive environments
- Teams running local and cloud LLMs
- Long-lived systems where methods will change

## ❌ When Fitz Is Not a Fit

- Prompt-only experiments
- One-off demos
- No ingestion, no retrieval needed

---

## 📁 Project Structure

```
fitz/
├── core/        # Stable contracts (Query, Answer, Provenance)
├── engines/     # Reasoning paradigms (classic_rag, clara)
├── ingest/      # Knowledge ingestion
├── runtime/     # Engine orchestration
├── llm/         # LLM plugins
└── vector_db/   # Vector DB plugins
```

Architecture enforces separation: engines can be added or removed without destabilizing the core.

## 💻 CLI
```bash
# First-time setup
fitz init                # Interactive config wizard
fitz quickstart          # End-to-end test with sample docs

# Daily usage
fitz-ingest run ./docs --collection my_kb
fitz-pipeline query "What is X?" --collection my_kb

# Diagnostics
fitz doctor
```

## 📐 Design Principles

- **Explicit over clever** | No hidden magic
- **Stable contracts** | The API doesn't break when internals change
- **Knowledge outlives methods** | Ingest once, query many ways
- **Engines are paradigms** | Not just config switches

---

## 💡 Philosophy

RAG is a method.  
Knowledge access is a strategy.

Fitz is built for the strategy.
