### Where to start 🚀

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `fitz retrieve` runs locally by default. SQLite stores the index and
> collection term graph; local ONNX models handle reranking and `pyrrho`
> governance. An OpenAI-compatible endpoint is only needed for explicitly
> configured features such as synthesis, vision, or optional background
> enrichment.

```bash
pip install fitz-sage

# From a docs folder, --source is optional.
fitz retrieve "What is our refund policy?" --source ./docs
```

The result is an `EvidencePack`: relevant source units, provenance, a governance verdict, and the signals needed to decide
what your application should do next.

---

### About

`fitz-sage` is a retrieval engine for local knowledge bases. It indexes code, documents, and tables into typed source units,
retrieves the units relevant to a question, reranks them, and returns a governed `EvidencePack` that downstream software can
inspect, display, store, or pass to a synthesizer.

⭐ The retrieval architecture is [KRAG (Knowledge Routing Augmented Generation)](docs/features/platform/krag.md). Code is parsed
as symbols, documents as sections, and tables as SQLite-backed data. Queries are routed across those
typed surfaces with retrieval strategies that match the source structure.

⭐ Governance is enforced by [`pyrrho`](https://huggingface.co/yafitzdev) in local CPU forward passes. `fitz-sage` starts with the
first three ranked sources and adds two only while `pyrrho` returns `INSUFFICIENT`.

### Why `fitz-sage`?

**EvidencePack as the contract 🧾**
> Every query returns ranked source evidence, provenance, governance reasons, and retrieval metadata. Use it directly in
> APIs, CLIs, dashboards, agents, or pass it to an LLM for answer generation with explicit governance metadata.

**Asymmetric indexing 🗂️** → [KRAG (Knowledge Routing Augmented Generation)](docs/features/platform/krag.md)
> Source files become typed retrieval units: code symbols, document sections, and tables. Each unit type
> keeps the structure needed to retrieve it well.

**Query-ready indexing 🐆** → [Searchable Index](docs/features/platform/searchable-index-background-enrichment.md)
> `point()` parses and stores supported files before returning. Retrieval can start immediately afterward while the
> background worker adds optional entity and hierarchy metadata.

**Keyword expansion from your corpus 🧩** → [Semantic Query Expansion](docs/features/retrieval/query-expansion.md)
> Each collection learns its own abbreviations, explicit aliases, identifier forms, and related terms. `fitz-sage` keeps the
> literal query and adds only source-backed terms to BM25 recall—without an LLM or global synonym list.

**Pyrrho-governed retrieval 🧭** → [Pyrrho docs](docs/CONSTRAINTS.md)
> `fitz-sage` combines deterministic query shape with `pyrrho` PRE obligations before retrieval, then `pyrrho` judges the selected evidence after reranking. The retrieval profile,
> reasons, and missing-evidence signals travel with the `EvidencePack`, so callers know whether to answer, show conflict,
> retrieve more, or ask for more source material.

**Queries that actually work 📊**
> Exact identifiers, temporal scopes, comparisons, aggregation requests, code lookups, table questions, and broad overview
> queries all flow through retrieval intelligence built into the engine.

**Tabular data that is actually searchable 📈** → [Unified Storage](docs/features/platform/unified-storage.md)
> Native CSV/TSV rows live in SQLite with schema detection, row-value BM25, and
> deterministic row grounding. Optional configured chat tiers can generate SQL
> for one retrieved table. Embedded document tables remain section text.

**Fully local execution possible 🏠**
> SQLite storage, corpus-derived semantic expansion, ONNX reranking, and ONNX `pyrrho` governance all run locally. Optional synthesis can use
> any local or cloud OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

####

> [!TIP]
> Try fitz on itself:
>
> ```bash
> fitz retrieve "How does the retrieval pipeline work?" --source ./fitz_sage
> ```

### What You Can Search

Traditional documents, source code, and tables have different structure. FitzKRAG preserves that structure during indexing
and retrieval.

<br>

| Retrieval Unit | Extracted From | How It Works |
|----------------|----------------|--------------|
| [**Symbols 🖌️**](docs/features/ingestion/code-symbol-extraction.md) | Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, Go, Java | AST/tree-sitter strategies extract addressable names, ranges, references, and file import edges. |
| **Sections 📑** | PDF, DOCX, PPTX, Markdown, text, config, markup | Parsed source text becomes sections with headings, ranges, and parent/child context; summaries are optional background metadata. |
| [**Tables 📅**](docs/features/ingestion/tabular-data-routing.md) | Configured delimited files (`.csv`, `.tsv` by default) | Native SQLite rows with schema lookup, row-value BM25, deterministic grounding, and optional generated SQL. |

<br>

> [!NOTE]
> All retrieval units share the same retrieval intelligence: query profiling, temporal handling, comparisons,
> aggregation, keyword expansion, reranking, progressive evidence delivery, and `pyrrho` governance.

### Retrieval Intelligence

[Retrieval Docs](docs/features/retrieval/README.md) • [Three-Stage Strategy](docs/features/retrieval/three-stage-strategy.md) • [Retrieval Pipeline](docs/RETRIEVAL_PIPELINE.md) • [Evidence Signals](docs/features/retrieval/evidence-signals.md)

`fitz-sage` runs retrieval as a typed, governed pipeline:

<br>

| Stage | What happens |
|-------|--------------|
| **0. User Query ❓** | User asks:<br>`"What are the company policies?"` |
| **1. Broad Recall 🔎** | Finds candidate evidence:<br>`Doc B`, `Doc C`, `Doc E`, `Doc H`, `Doc L` |
| **2. Rerank 🎯** | Reorders by relevance:<br>`Doc E`, `Doc B`, `Doc H`, `Doc L`, `Doc C` |
| **3. Sufficiency Check 🛡️** | Adds evidence until the user query is sufficiently supported:<br>`User query` + `Doc E` → ❌<br>`User query` + `Doc E` + `Doc B` → ❌<br>`User query` + `Doc E` + `Doc B` + `Doc H` → ✅ |
| **4. Synthesis (optional) 💡** | Verified evidence can be passed to an LLM:<br>LLM(`User query`, `Doc E`, `Doc B`, `Doc H`) |

<br>

The query-ready path is keyword-first: exact query terms, collection-derived
semantic terms, and BM25. Enriched collections can additionally use hierarchy
summaries, entity links, and broader context expansion.

[Built-in intelligence](docs/features/retrieval) handles the edge cases that break simple search:

<br>

| Feature | Query | What `fitz-sage` Uses |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| ✅ [**epistemic-honesty**](docs/features/governance/epistemic-honesty.md) | "What was our Q4 revenue?" | `pyrrho` verdict and insufficient-evidence reasons |
| ✅ [**keyword-vocabulary**](docs/features/retrieval/keyword-vocabulary.md) | "Find TC_1000" | Literal identifier search |
| ✅ [**sparse-search**](docs/features/retrieval/sparse-search.md) | "error code E_AUTH_401" | SQLite FTS5 + native `bm25()` |
| ✅ [**hierarchical-rag**](docs/features/ingestion/hierarchical-rag.md) | "What are the design principles?" | Hierarchical summaries when enrichment has produced them |
| ✅ [**multi-query**](docs/features/retrieval/multi-query-rag.md) | *[User pastes 500-char test report]* "What failed and why?" | Multi-query decomposition |
| ✅ [**comparison-queries**](docs/features/retrieval/comparison-queries.md) | "Compare React vs Vue performance" | Multi-entity retrieval coverage |
| ✅ [**entity-graph**](docs/features/retrieval/entity-graph.md) | "What else mentions AuthService?" | Entity links for enriched source files |
| ✅ [**temporal-queries**](docs/features/retrieval/temporal-queries.md) | "What changed between Q1 and Q2?" | Temporal scope detection |
| ✅ [**aggregation-queries**](docs/features/retrieval/aggregation-queries.md) | "List all the test cases that failed" | Exhaustive/list query handling |
| ✅ [**freshness-authority**](docs/features/retrieval/freshness-authority.md) | "What's the latest status on feature X?" | Content-grounded temporal scope; no filesystem-age scoring |
| ✅ [**semantic-keywords**](docs/features/retrieval/query-expansion.md) | "What does SLA require?" | Collection-local SQLite term graph; literal query retained |
| ✅ [**reranking**](docs/features/retrieval/reranking.md) | "What's the battery warranty?" | ONNX cross-encoder reranker |

<br>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Retrieval intelligence is baked in. Configuration declares providers; the engine decides which retrieval capabilities a
> query needs.

Fitz-Sage does not rewrite conversational or ambiguous queries. Rewrite those
queries before submitting them when the question depends on context that is not
present in the query itself. See [Limitations](docs/LIMITATIONS.md).

<summary><strong>📦 EvidencePack</strong> → <a href="docs/EVIDENCE_PACK.md">Full Contract</a></summary>

<br>

[Evidence Pack Contract](docs/EVIDENCE_PACK.md) • [Evidence Signals](docs/features/retrieval/evidence-signals.md)

`EvidencePack` is the output contract of `fitz-sage`.

It gives you the relevant sources and the governance signals around them. You can show it directly, pass it to a model,
trigger a workflow from it, or store it as an audit artifact.

The source items are the evidence. The signals around them explain how `fitz-sage` searched before retrieval and what `pyrrho` judged
after retrieval.

#### Pre-retrieval 🔎

Before retrieval, `fitz-sage` builds a search plan from deterministic query analysis,
the collection term graph, and explicit query clauses.

| Signal | What it means | Why it matters |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| `query_type` / `analysis_type` | Narrow lookup, comparison, temporal, aggregation, broad overview, or general query shape. | Sets recall breadth and evidence coverage. |
| `keywords` | Evidence-backed collection expansions and literal deterministic query terms. | Adds collection-specific lexical candidates without embeddings. |
| `strategy_weights` | Relative weight for code, section, and table retrieval. | Makes the first pass search the right evidence surfaces. |
| `top_k` / `top_read` | How much candidate evidence `fitz-sage` should collect and read. | Keeps narrow lookups fast while giving broad or comparative questions enough coverage. |
| `rerank_candidates` | How many recalled candidates the cross-encoder scores. | Bounds neural CPU cost without shrinking the BM25 recall pool used by evidence rescue. |

#### Post-retrieval 🛡️

After retrieval, reranking, closure, and compilation, `fitz-sage` sends `pyrrho` the
first three ranked items. An exact `INSUFFICIENT` verdict adds the next two;
`SUFFICIENT` or `DISPUTED` stops immediately. These signals tell you whether
the result is usable.

| Signal | What it means | What you can do with it |
|--------|---------------|-------------------------|
| `mode` | Mechanical `fitz-sage` mapping of `pyrrho`'s `SUFFICIENT`, `DISPUTED`, or `INSUFFICIENT` verdict. | Gate generated answers, UI display, automation, or human review. |
| `reasons` | Plain-language explanation for the verdict. | Show users why `fitz-sage` judged evidence sufficient, disputed, or insufficient. |
| `evidence_verdict` | Verdict: `SUFFICIENT`, `DISPUTED`, or `INSUFFICIENT`. | Inspect the evidence judgment. |
| `failure_mode` | Reason when evidence is insufficient or disputed. | Explain why the evidence cannot safely support a clean answer. |
| `retrieval_intents` | Evidence intent metadata such as lookup, temporal resolution, comparison, or broad coverage. | Decide whether another retrieval pass should focus on coverage, time, lookup, or comparison. |
| `evidence_kinds` | Evidence-surface metadata such as text, table, code, config, logs, or document layout. | Decide which evidence surface is missing or should be emphasized. |

This is why `fitz-sage` is useful as infrastructure: the package returns source evidence plus enough judgment to decide the
next action.

#### Retrieval execution records

When an `EvidencePack` is not enough to diagnose a result, `RetrievalRun`
records the actual query plan, term origins, candidate stages, compiled ranking,
evaluated evidence prefixes, exact `pyrrho` outputs, and runtime fingerprints
from the same execution.

```bash
fitz retrieve "Which test failed?" -c reports --trace run.json
fitz explain run.json
```

Trace exports redact source bodies by default. Content-bearing traces are an
explicit opt-in and enable `pyrrho`-only replay over frozen evidence. See
[Retrieval Execution Records](docs/RETRIEVAL_RUNS.md).

`pyrrho` is the local governance model behind `fitz-sage`. Its default CPU-local
ONNX ModernBERT model
[`yafitzdev/pyrrho-v2-nano-g1`](https://huggingface.co/yafitzdev/pyrrho-v2-nano-g1)
is pinned to an immutable Hub revision and cached by `fitz-sage` through the

| `evidence_kinds` | Evidence-surface metadata, such as text, table, code, config, logs, or document layout. |

`fitz-sage` passes every ranked prefix to `pyrrho` unchanged. Its managed ONNX
adapter applies the model's fixed input and head-decoding contract, maps the
resulting verdict into `AnswerMode`, and returns the stopping prefix plus the
exact serialized decisions with the `EvidencePack`. Applications can answer,
retry, show conflict, or request more source material.

<br>

> [!NOTE]
> Governance is a source-evidence judgment. `pyrrho` is trained to decide whether retrieved evidence is sufficient,
> disputed, or insufficient, and `fitz-sage` records that judgment in the returned metadata.

<strong>The model adapter fails closed on known contract violations 🛡️</strong>
> `fitz-sage`'s managed `pyrrho` adapter checks the model artifact, label order, ONNX
> width, token limits, graph parity, and verdict/failure compatibility before

<summary><strong>📦 Real-World Usage</strong></summary>

<br>

`fitz-sage` is a retrieval foundation. It manages indexing, search, reranking,
`pyrrho` integration, and provenance so products can
build on source evidence.

<br>

<strong>Chatbot Backend 🤖</strong>

> Connect fitz to Slack, Discord, Teams, or your own UI. The bot can show source-backed evidence, ask for more documents
> when `pyrrho` marks evidence insufficient, or call `fitz answer` for generated prose.
>
> *Example:* A support bot retrieves policy sections, shows links to the relevant docs, and only synthesizes when the
> evidence verdict is sufficient.

<br>

<strong>Internal Knowledge Base 📖</strong>

> Point fitz at your wiki, policies, runbooks, and repos. Employees ask natural-language questions and get source units
> with provenance.
>
> *Example:* New hires ask "How do I request PTO?" and receive the exact policy section plus the governance verdict.

<br>

<strong>Continuous Intelligence & Alerting (Watchdog) 🐶</strong>

> Run scheduled queries over changing folders, logs, reports, or exports. Trigger alerts when the evidence pack contains
> sufficient sources, disputes, or missing-coverage signals.
>
> *Example:* A nightly job asks "Were there failed logins from unusual locations?" and sends the evidence pack to the
> on-call channel.

<br>

<strong>Web Knowledge Base 🌎</strong>

> Scrape web pages to disk, point fitz at the folder, and query the resulting corpus with provenance.
>
> *Example:* A research workflow scrapes reports, stores them locally, and asks comparative or temporal questions across
> the collected source set.

<br>

<strong>Codebase Search 🐍</strong> → [Code Symbol Extraction](docs/features/ingestion/code-symbol-extraction.md) • [KRAG](docs/features/platform/krag.md)

> **Code retrieval:**
>
> Tree-sitter parses your codebase into symbols with qualified names, references, and import graphs. Function and class
> lookup is address-based, and dependency questions can use graph expansion.
>
> *Example:* A team asks "Where is user authentication handled?" and receives specific functions, files, and symbol
> addresses rather than generic file snippets.

```bash
fitz retrieve "question" --source ./docs     # Return governed evidence
fitz retrieve "question"                     # Use current folder or existing collection
fitz retrieve "question" --format json    # Evidence with script-friendly controls
fitz answer "question" --synthesizer ...  # Generated prose from evidence
fitz collections                          # List and delete knowledge collections
fitz serve                                # Start REST API server
```

Config: `.fitz/config.yaml` in the current workspace - auto-created on first run. Edit it for optional synthesis, vision, or custom
model/provider choices.

<summary><strong>📦 Python SDK Reference</strong> → <a href="docs/SDK.md">Full SDK Guide</a></summary>

<br>

**Simple usage (module-level, matches CLI):**
```python
import fitz_sage

pack = fitz_sage.evidence("What is the refund policy?", source="./docs")
print(pack.mode)
```

<br>

**Advanced usage (multiple collections):**
```python
from fitz_sage import fitz

# Create separate instances for different collections
physics = fitz(collection="physics")
legal = fitz(collection="legal")

# Retrieve evidence from each collection
physics_pack = physics.evidence("Explain entanglement", source="./physics_papers")
legal_pack = legal.evidence("What are the payment terms?", source="./contracts")
```

<br>

**Working with evidence:**
```python
pack = fitz_sage.evidence("Where is pyrrho governance implemented?", source="./fitz_sage")

print(pack.mode)  # runtime AnswerMode: SUFFICIENT, DISPUTED, or INSUFFICIENT
print(pack.reasons)

for item in pack.items:
    print(item.file_path, item.address_location, item.line_range)
```

<summary><strong>📦 REST API Reference</strong> → <a href="docs/API.md">Full API Guide</a></summary>

<br>

**Start the server:**
```bash
pip install fitz-sage[api]

# Initialize the workspace and collection once
fitz retrieve "What is indexed?" --source ./docs

fitz serve                    # localhost:8000
fitz serve -p 3000            # custom port
$env:FITZ_API_KEY = "replace-with-a-random-secret"
fitz serve --host 0.0.0.0     # remote access requires the API key
```

**Interactive docs:** Visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` for Swagger UI.

**Endpoints:**

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/answer` | Return an optional synthesized answer |
| POST | `/evidence` | Return governed evidence without synthesis |
| POST | `/chat` | Return generated prose from retrieved evidence |
| GET | `/collections` | List all collections |
| GET | `/collections/{name}` | Get collection stats |
| POST | `/collections/{name}/documents` | Build/update the searchable source index |
| GET | `/collections/{name}/status` | Inspect source-index and enrichment status |
| DELETE | `/collections/{name}` | Delete a collection |
| GET | `/health` | Health check |

<br>

**Example request:**

`/answer` and `/chat` require a configured synthesizer. `/evidence` does not.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/answer \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What is the refund policy?", "collection": "default"}'
```

<summary><strong>📦 FAQ / Troubleshooting</strong></summary>

<br>

**`fitz` command not found after install**
> Your Python Scripts directory is not on PATH. Use `python -m fitz_sage.cli.cli`, or add the Scripts directory to PATH.

**PDF/DOCX/PPTX files are being skipped**
> The base install reads embedded text from these formats. Image-only files
> need an OCR-capable parser. `parser: glm_ocr` expects a local Ollama
> `glm-ocr` model; install `fitz-sage[docs]` only when you explicitly select a
> Docling parser.

**"Connection refused at localhost:8080" error**
> This applies to optional endpoint-backed synthesis or vision parsing. `fitz retrieve "..."` returns evidence without an
> endpoint server. For generated prose:
> `fitz answer "..." --synthesizer openai/gpt-4o`.

**"Model not found" error**
> The model name in your config does not match what your server has loaded. Check `/v1/models` on your server:
> `curl http://localhost:8080/v1/models`. Then update `synthesizer` in `.fitz/config.yaml`.

**First query is slow**
> First run initializes storage, downloads managed local models if needed, and builds the query-ready index. Later queries
> reuse the collection.

**How do I change my LLM endpoint or model?**
> Edit `.fitz/config.yaml`:
> ```yaml
> synthesizer: endpoint/gpt-oss-20b
> chat_base_url: http://localhost:8080/v1
> ```
> Or override at the CLI:
> ```bash
> fitz answer "..." --endpoint http://localhost:8080/v1 --synthesizer endpoint/gpt-oss-20b
> ```

**How do I use a cloud provider?**
> Either use the `openai` preset:
> ```yaml
> synthesizer: openai/gpt-4o
> # OPENAI_API_KEY in env
> ```
> Or any OpenAI-compatible cloud via the `endpoint` provider:
> ```yaml
> synthesizer: endpoint/meta-llama-3.1-70b
> chat_base_url: https://api.together.xyz/v1
> chat_api_key_env: TOGETHER_API_KEY
> ```
> See [docs/features/platform/openai-compatible-endpoint.md](docs/features/platform/openai-compatible-endpoint.md).

**How do I reset everything?**
> Delete the `.fitz/` directory in your project root. Next run will initialize a fresh workspace.
