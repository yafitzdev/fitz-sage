### Where to start

```bash
pip install fitz-ai

fitz query "What is our refund policy?" --source ./docs
```

That's it. Your documents are now searchable with AI.

### About

Existing RAG tools hallucinate. When the answer isn't in your documents, they invent one — confidently, fluently, wrongly. In production, that's not a minor inconvenience. It's the reason you can't trust the system. I built fitz-ai to solve that problem directly, while working as a Data Engineer in the automotive industry. No LangChain. No LlamaIndex. Every layer written from scratch.

The retrieval architecture is [KRAG (Knowledge Routing Augmented Generation)](docs/features/platform/krag.md) — documents are parsed into typed units (code symbols, sections, tables) and each query is routed to the right search strategy, rather than searching flat chunks uniformly.

Honesty is enforced by an [ML governance classifier](docs/features/governance/governance-benchmarking.md) that decides when to answer, hedge, refuse — validated against [fitz-gov](https://github.com/yafitzdev/fitz-gov), a purpose-built benchmark of 2,900+ adversarial test cases.

It runs in production today and powers [fitz-graveyard](https://github.com/yafitzdev/fitz-graveyard).

~55k lines of Python. 2,000+ tests. 99% coverage.

<summary><strong>📦 What is RAG?</strong></summary>

<br>

RAG is how ChatGPT's "file search," Notion AI, and enterprise knowledge tools actually work under the hood.
Instead of sending all your documents to an AI, RAG:

1. [X] **Indexes your documents** — Splits them into chunks, converts to vectors, stores in a database
2. [X] **Retrieves only what's relevant** — When you ask a question, finds the 5-10 most relevant chunks
3. [X] **Sends just those chunks to the LLM** — The AI answers based on focused, relevant context

Traditional approach:
```
  [All 10,000 documents] → LLM → Answer
  ❌ Impossible (too large)
  ❌ Expensive (if possible)
  ❌ Unfocused
```
RAG approach:
```
  Question → [Search index] → [5 relevant chunks] → LLM → Answer
  ✅ Works at any scale
  ✅ Costs pennies per query
  ✅ Focused context = better answers
```

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>📦 Why Can't I Just Send My Documents to ChatGPT directly?</strong></summary>

<br>

You can—but you'll hit walls fast.

**Context window limits 🚨**
> GPT-4 accepts ~128k tokens. That's roughly 300 pages. Your company wiki, codebase, or document archive is likely 10x-100x larger. You physically cannot paste it all.

**Cost explosion 💥**
> Even if you could fit everything, you'd pay for every token on every query. Sending 100k tokens costs ~\$1-3 per question. Ask 50 questions a day? That's $50-150 daily—for one user.

**No selective retrieval ❌**
> When you paste documents, the model reads everything equally. It can't focus on what's relevant. Ask about refund policies and it's also processing your hiring guidelines, engineering specs, and meeting notes—wasting context and degrading answers.

**No persistence 💢**
> Every conversation starts fresh. You re-upload, re-paste, re-explain. There's no knowledge base that accumulates and improves.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>📦 How is this different from LangChain / LlamaIndex?</strong></summary>

<br>

They're frameworks — you assemble the chunker, embedder, vector store, retriever, and prompt chain yourself. fitz-ai is a library — one function call that handles all of it with built-in intelligence.

You trade flexibility for a pipeline that handles temporal queries, comparison queries, code symbol extraction, tabular SQL, and epistemic honesty out of the box — without configuration.

</details>

---

### Why Fitz?

**Asymmetric indexing 🗂️** → [KRAG (Knowledge Routing Augmented Generation)](docs/features/platform/krag.md)
> Documents are parsed into typed retrieval units (symbols, sections, tables) with structural metadata, not flat chunks. Queries are routed to the right strategy per content type.

**Zero-wait querying 🐆** → [Progressive KRAG](docs/features/platform/progressive-krag-agentic-search.md)
> Ask a question immediately — no ingestion step required. Fitz serves answers instantly via agentic search while a background worker indexes your files. Queries get faster over time as indexing completes, but they work from second one.

**Honest answers ✅** → [Governance Benchmark](docs/features/governance/governance-benchmarking.md)
> Most RAG tools confidently answer even when the answer isn't in your documents. Ask "What was our Q4 revenue?" when your docs only cover Q1-Q3, and typical RAG hallucinates a number. Fitz says: *"I cannot find Q4 revenue figures in the provided documents."
>
> → Fitz detects when to abstain at **90.2% recall** on [fitz-gov 5.0](https://github.com/yafitzdev/fitz-gov), a 2,900+ case benchmark for epistemic honesty (62.7% hard difficulty).

**Actionable failures 🔍**
> When Fitz can't answer, it doesn't just refuse — it explains what it searched for, shows related topics that *do* exist, and suggests what documents to add. When sources conflict, Fitz tells you exactly which sources disagree and what the disagreement is about. Every failure mode is a feedback signal, not a dead end.

**Queries that actually work 📊**
> Standard RAG fails silently on real queries. Fitz has built-in intelligence: hierarchical summaries for "What are the trends?", exact keyword matching for "Find TC-1000", multi-query decomposition for complex questions, address-based code retrieval with import graph traversal, and SQL execution for tabular data. No configuration—it just works.

**Tabular data that is actually searchable 📈** → [Unified Storage](docs/features/platform/unified-storage.md)
> CSV and table data is a nightmare in most RAG systems—chunked arbitrarily, structure lost, queries fail. Fitz stores tables natively in PostgreSQL alongside your vectors—same database, no sync issues. Auto-detects schema and runs real SQL. Ask "What's the average price by region?" and get an actual computed answer, not fragmented rows.

**Fully local execution possible 🏠**
> Embedded PostgreSQL + Ollama/LM Studio. No API keys required to start.

####

> [!TIP]
> Any questions left? Try fitz on itself:
>
> ```bash
> fitz query "How does the retrieval pipeline work?" --source ./fitz_ai
> ```
>
> The codebase speaks for itself.

---

### What You Can Search

Traditional RAG chops every document into flat text blocks and searches them the same way. [FitzKRAG](docs/features/platform/krag.md) parses each document by type — tree-sitter for code, heading hierarchy for docs, schema detection for CSVs — and produces typed retrieval units, each with its own storage format and search strategy.

<br>

| Retrieval Unit              | Extracted From | How It Works |
|-----------------------------|----------------|-------------|
| [**Symbols 🖌️**](docs/features/ingestion/code-symbol-extraction.md) | Code files | Tree-sitter parses functions, classes, and methods into addressable units with qualified names, references, and import graphs. Cross-file dependencies are graph traversals, not text searches. |
| **Sections 📑** | Documents (PDF, markdown, text) | Headings and paragraphs are extracted with parent/child hierarchy. Deeply nested sections include parent context; top-level headings include child summaries. |
| [**Tables 📅**](docs/features/ingestion/tabular-data-routing.md) | CSV files or tables within documents | Native PostgreSQL storage with auto-detected schema. Real SQL execution from natural language — not chunked text. |
| **Images 🖼️** | Figures and diagrams within documents | VLM-powered figure extraction and visual understanding. *(Coming soon)* |
| **Chunks 🧩** | Any content as fallback | Traditional chunk-based retrieval when structured extraction doesn't apply. Automatic fallback — no configuration needed. |

<br>

> [!NOTE]
> All retrieval units share the same retrieval intelligence (temporal handling, comparison queries, multi-hop reasoning, etc.) and the same enrichment pipeline (summaries, keywords, entities, hierarchical summaries).

---

### Retrieval Intelligence

Most RAG implementations are naive vector search—they fail silently on real-world queries. Fitz has [built-in intelligence](docs/features/retrieval) that handles edge cases automatically:

<br>

| Feature | Query | Naive RAG Problem | Fitz Solution |
|---------|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| [**epistemic-honesty**](docs/features/governance/epistemic-honesty.md) | "What was our Q4 revenue?" | ❌ Hallucinated number — Info doesn't exist, but LLM won't admit it | ✅ "I don't know" |
| [**keyword-vocabulary**](docs/features/retrieval/keyword-vocabulary.md) | "Find TC_1000" | ❌ Wrong test case — Embeddings see TC_1000 ≈ TC_2000 (semantically similar) | ✅ Exact keyword matching |
| [**hybrid-search**](docs/features/retrieval/hybrid-search.md) | "X100 battery specs" | ❌ Returns Y200 docs — Semantic search misses exact model numbers | ✅ Hybrid search (dense + sparse) |
| [**sparse-search**](docs/features/retrieval/sparse-search.md) | "error code E_AUTH_401" | ❌ No exact match — Embeddings miss precise error codes | ✅ PostgreSQL full-text search |
| [**multi-hop**](docs/features/retrieval/multi-hop-reasoning.md) | "Who wrote the paper cited by the 2023 review?" | ❌ Returns the review only — Single-step search can't traverse references | ✅ Iterative retrieval |
| [**hierarchical-rag**](docs/features/ingestion/hierarchical-rag.md) | "What are the design principles?" | ❌ Random fragments — Answer is spread across docs; no single chunk contains it | ✅ Hierarchical summaries |
| [**multi-query**](docs/features/retrieval/multi-query-rag.md) | *[User pastes 500-char test report]* "What failed and why?" | ❌ Vaguely related chunks — Long input → averaged embedding → matches nothing specifically | ✅ Multi-query decomposition |
| [**comparison-queries**](docs/features/retrieval/comparison-queries.md) | "Compare React vs Vue performance" | ❌ Incomplete comparison — Only retrieves one entity, missing the other | ✅ Multi-entity retrieval |
| [**entity-graph**](docs/features/retrieval/entity-graph.md) | "What else mentions AuthService?" | ❌ Isolated chunks — No awareness of shared entities across docs | ✅ Entity-based linking across sources |
| [**temporal-queries**](docs/features/retrieval/temporal-queries.md) | "What changed between Q1 and Q2?" | ❌ Random chunks — No awareness of time periods in query | ✅ Temporal query handling |
| [**aggregation-queries**](docs/features/retrieval/aggregation-queries.md) | "List all the test cases that failed" | ❌ Partial list — No mechanism for comprehensive retrieval | ✅ Aggregation query handling |
| [**freshness-authority**](docs/features/retrieval/freshness-authority.md) | "What does the official spec say?" | ❌ Returns notes — Can't distinguish authoritative vs informal sources | ✅ Freshness/authority boosting |
| [**query-expansion**](docs/features/retrieval/query-expansion.md) | "How do I fetch the db config?" | ❌ No matches — User says "fetch", docs say "retrieve"; "db" vs "database" | ✅ Query expansion |
| [**query-rewriting**](docs/features/retrieval/query-rewriting.md) | "Tell me more about it" *(after discussing TechCorp)* | ❌ Lost context — Pronouns like "it" reference nothing, retrieval fails | ✅ Conversational context resolution |
| [**hyde**](docs/features/retrieval/hyde.md) | "What's TechCorp's approach to sustainability?" | ❌ Poor recall — Abstract queries don't embed close to concrete documents | ✅ Hypothetical document generation |
| [**contextual-embeddings**](docs/features/retrieval/contextual-embeddings.md) | "When does it expire?" | ❌ Ambiguous chunk — "It expires in 24h" embedded without context; "it" = ? | ✅ Summary-prefixed symbol/section embeddings |
| [**reranking**](docs/features/retrieval/reranking.md) | "What's the battery warranty?" | ❌ Imprecise ranking — Vector similarity ≠ true relevance; best answer buried | ✅ Cross-encoder precision |

<br>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These features are **always on**—no configuration needed. Fitz automatically detects when to use each capability.

### Governance — Know What You Don't Know

[Feature docs](docs/features/governance/governance-benchmarking.md) • [fitz-gov benchmark](https://github.com/yafitzdev/fitz-gov)

Most RAG systems hallucinate confidently. Fitz **measures and enforces** epistemic honesty using a 4-question cascade ML classifier trained on 2,900+ labeled cases from [fitz-gov](https://github.com/yafitzdev/fitz-gov), a benchmark for epistemic honesty.

|----------|--------------------------------------|-----------|
| **ABSTAIN** | Evidence doesn't answer the question | **90.2%** |
| **DISPUTED** | Sources contradict each other        | **74.9%** |
| **TRUSTWORTHY** | Consistent, sufficient evidence      | **78.6%** |

**Overall accuracy: 81.3%** on fitz-gov 5.0 (2,910 cases, 5-fold cross-validated, 62.7% hard difficulty)

<br>

> [!NOTE]
> Governance asks "given three relevant documents that partially contradict each other, should you flag a dispute, hedge the answer, or trust the consensus?" That's a judgment call even humans disagree on.

<strong>The system fails safe 🛡️</strong>
> The safety-first threshold is tuned so that when the classifier is wrong, it over-hedges ("disputed" instead of "trustworthy") — annoying but harmless. Over-confidence ("trustworthy" instead of "disputed") is the rarest error mode.

<strong>These scores are a floor, not a ceiling 👣</strong>
> All benchmarks were measured using `qwen2.5:3b` — a 3B parameter local model. The governance constraints run on the fast-tier LLM to keep latency low. Stronger models produce better constraint signals, which feed better features into the classifier. Upgrading your chat provider should improve governance accuracy for free.

<strong>Zero extra latency ⏱️</strong>
> The constraints already run as part of the pipeline. The ML classifier just replaces hand-coded rules with a local sklearn model — inference takes microseconds, no additional API calls.

<summary><strong>📦 Real-World Usage</strong></summary>

<br>

Fitz is a foundation. It handles document indexing and grounded retrieval—you build whatever sits on top: chatbots, dashboards, alerts, or automation.

<br>

<strong>Chatbot Backend 🤖</strong>

> Connect fitz to Slack, Discord, Teams, or your own UI. One function call returns an answer with sources—no hallucinations, full provenance. You handle the conversation flow; fitz handles the knowledge.
>
> *Example:* A SaaS company plugs fitz into their support bot. Tier-1 questions like "How do I reset my password?" get instant answers. Their support team focuses on edge cases while fitz deflects 60% of incoming tickets.

<br>

<strong>Internal Knowledge Base 📖</strong>

> Point fitz at your company's wiki, policies, and runbooks. Employees ask natural language questions instead of hunting through folders or pinging colleagues on Slack.
>
> *Example:* A 200-person startup points fitz at their Notion workspace and compliance docs. New hires find answers to "How do I request PTO?" on day one—no more waiting for someone in HR to respond.

<br>

<strong>Continuous Intelligence & Alerting (Watchdog) 🐶</strong>

> Pair fitz with cron, Airflow, or Lambda. Point at data on a schedule, run queries automatically, trigger alerts when conditions match. Fitz provides the retrieval primitive; you wire the automation.
>
> *Example:* A security team points fitz at SIEM logs nightly. Every morning, a scheduled job asks "Were there failed logins from unusual locations?" If fitz finds evidence, an alert fires to the on-call channel before anyone checks email.

<br>

<strong>Web Knowledge Base 🌎</strong>

> Scrape the web with Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, or Playwright. Save to disk, point fitz at it. The web becomes a queryable knowledge base.
>
> *Example:* A football analytics hobbyist scrapes Premier League match reports. They point fitz at the folder and ask "How did Arsenal perform against top 6 teams?" or "What tactics did Liverpool use in away games?"—insights that would take hours to compile manually.

<br>

<strong>Codebase Search 🐍</strong> → [Code Symbol Extraction](docs/features/ingestion/code-symbol-extraction.md) • [KRAG](docs/features/platform/krag.md)

> **Two modes of code retrieval:**
>
> **Full KRAG** — tree-sitter parses your codebase into symbols (functions, classes, methods) with qualified names, references, and import graphs. No chunking—each symbol is a precise, addressable unit. Cross-file dependencies are tracked, so "what calls this function?" is a graph traversal, not a text search.
>
> **Standalone (`pip install fitz-ai[code]`)** — Zero-dependency code retrieval via `CodeRetriever`. Builds an AST structural index, uses an LLM to select relevant files, expands via import graph and neighbor directories, and returns compressed results. No PostgreSQL, no pgvector, no docling—just point at a directory and ask.
>
> *Example:* A team inherits a legacy Django monolith—200k lines, sparse docs. They point fitz at the codebase and ask "Where is user authentication handled?" or "What depends on the billing module?" FitzKRAG returns specific functions with their callers and dependencies. New developers onboard in days instead of weeks.

answer = fitz_ai.query("What is the refund policy?", source="./docs")
print(answer.text)
```

<br>

**Advanced usage (multiple collections):**
```python
from fitz_ai import fitz

# Create separate instances for different collections
physics = fitz(collection="physics")
legal = fitz(collection="legal")

# Query each collection
physics_answer = physics.query("Explain entanglement", source="./physics_papers")
legal_answer = legal.query("What are the payment terms?", source="./contracts")
```

<br>

**Working with answers:**
```python
answer = fitz_ai.query("What is the refund policy?")

print(answer.text)
print(answer.mode)  # TRUSTWORTHY, DISPUTED, or ABSTAIN

for source in answer.provenance:
    print(f"Source: {source.source_id}")
    print(f"Excerpt: {source.excerpt}")
```
