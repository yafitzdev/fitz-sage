<summary><strong>📦 What is RAG?</strong></summary>

<br>

RAG is how ChatGPT's "file search," Notion AI, and enterprise knowledge tools actually work under the hood.
Instead of sending all your documents to an AI, RAG:

1. [X] **Indexes your documents once** — Splits them into chunks, converts to vectors, stores in a database
2. [X] **Retrieves only what's relevant** — When you ask a question, finds the 5-10 most relevant chunks
3. [X] **Sends just those chunks to the LLM** — The AI answers based on focused, relevant context

Traditional approach:
```
  [All 10,000 documents] → LLM → Answer
  ❌ Impossible (too large)
  ❌ Expensive (if possible)
  ❌ Unfocused
```
RAG approach:
```
  Question → [Search index] → [5 relevant chunks] → LLM → Answer
  ✅ Works at any scale
  ✅ Costs pennies per query
  ✅ Focused context = better answers
```

<summary><strong>📦 Why Can't I Just Send My Documents to ChatGPT directly?</strong></summary>

<br>

You can—but you'll hit walls fast.

**Context window limits 🚨** 
> GPT-4 accepts ~128k tokens. That's roughly 300 pages. Your company wiki, codebase, or document archive is likely 10x-100x larger. You physically cannot paste it all.

**Cost explosion 💥**
> Even if you could fit everything, you'd pay for every token on every query. Sending 100k tokens costs ~\$1-3 per question. Ask 50 questions a day? That's $50-150 daily—for one user.

**No selective retrieval ❌**
> When you paste documents, the model reads everything equally. It can't focus on what's relevant. Ask about refund policies and it's also processing your hiring guidelines, engineering specs, and meeting notes—wasting context and degrading answers.

**No persistence 💢**
> Every conversation starts fresh. You re-upload, re-paste, re-explain. There's no knowledge base that accumulates and improves.

### Why Fitz?

**Super fast setup 🐆**
> Point at a folder. Ask a question. Get an answer with sources. Even for tables! Everything else is handled by Fitz.

**Honest answers ✅** → [Governance Benchmark](#governance-know-what-you-dont-know)
> Most RAG tools confidently answer even when the answer isn't in your documents. Ask "What was our Q4 revenue?" when your docs only cover Q1-Q3, and typical RAG hallucinates a number. Fitz says: *"I cannot find Q4 revenue figures in the provided documents."*
>
> **Measured, not claimed:** Fitz detects disputes at **89.7% recall** on [fitz-gov](https://github.com/yafitzdev/fitz-gov), a 1,100+ case benchmark for epistemic honesty. A two-stage ML classifier trained on labeled boundary cases replaces hand-coded rules.

**Queries that actually work 📊**
> Standard RAG fails silently on real queries. Fitz has built-in intelligence: hierarchical summaries for "What are the trends?", exact keyword matching for "Find TC-1000", multi-query decomposition for complex questions, AST-aware chunking for code, and SQL execution for tabular data. No configuration—it just works.

**Tabular data that is actually searchable 📈** → [Unified Storage](docs/features/unified-storage.md)
> CSV and table data is a nightmare in most RAG systems—chunked arbitrarily, structure lost, queries fail. Fitz stores tables natively in PostgreSQL alongside your vectors—same database, no sync issues. Auto-detects schema and runs real SQL. Ask "What's the average price by region?" and get an actual computed answer, not fragmented rows.

**Other Features at a Glance 🃏**
>1. [x] **Fully local execution possible.** Embedded PostgreSQL + Ollama, no API keys required to start.
>2. [x] **Plugin-based architecture.** Swap LLMs, rerankers, and retrieval pipelines via YAML config.
>3. [x] **Extensible engine system.** FitzRAG built-in, with a clean registry for adding custom engines.
>4. [X] **Incremental ingestion.** Only reprocesses changed files, even with new chunking settings.
>5. [x] **Full provenance.** Every answer traces back to the exact chunk and document.
>6. [x] **Data privacy**: No telemetry, no cloud, no external calls except to the LLM provider you configure.
>7. [x] **[Enterprise gateway support](docs/features/enterprise-gateway.md).** OAuth2 M2M, custom CA certs, mTLS, and corporate proxy/gateway integration.

####

> [!TIP]
> Any questions left? Try fitz on itself:
> 
> ```bash
> fitz quickstart ./fitz_ai "How does the chunking pipeline work?"
> ```
>
> The codebase speaks for itself.

### Retrieval Intelligence

Most RAG implementations are naive vector search—they fail silently on real-world queries. Fitz has **built-in intelligence** that handles edge cases automatically:

<br>

| Feature | Query | Naive RAG Problem | FitzRAG Solution |
|---------|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| [**epistemic-honesty**](docs/features/epistemic-honesty.md) | "What was our Q4 revenue?" | ❌ Hallucinated number — Info doesn't exist, but LLM won't admit it | ✅ "I don't know" |
| [**governance-benchmarking**](docs/features/governance-benchmarking.md) | *[Benchmark: fitz-gov]* | ❌ No measurement — Retrieval benchmarks don't test epistemic honesty | ✅ 89.7% dispute detection, 81.2% abstain (ML classifier, 1100+ cases) |
| [**keyword-vocabulary**](docs/features/keyword-vocabulary.md) | "Find TC_1000" | ❌ Wrong test case — Embeddings see TC_1000 ≈ TC_2000 (semantically similar) | ✅ Exact keyword matching |
| [**hybrid-search**](docs/features/hybrid-search.md) | "X100 battery specs" | ❌ Returns Y200 docs — Semantic search misses exact model numbers | ✅ Hybrid search (dense + sparse) |
| [**sparse-search**](docs/features/sparse-search.md) | "error code E_AUTH_401" | ❌ No exact match — Embeddings miss precise error codes | ✅ PostgreSQL full-text search |
| [**multi-hop**](docs/features/multi-hop-reasoning.md) | "Who wrote the paper cited by the 2023 review?" | ❌ Returns the review only — Single-step search can't traverse references | ✅ Iterative retrieval |
| [**hierarchical-rag**](docs/features/hierarchical-rag.md) | "What are the design principles?" | ❌ Random fragments — Answer is spread across docs; no single chunk contains it | ✅ Hierarchical summaries |
| [**tabular-data-routing**](docs/features/tabular-data-routing.md) | "What's the timeout for CAN?" *(table)* | ❌ Fragmented rows — Tables chunked arbitrarily, structure lost | ✅ SQL on structured data |
| [**multi-query**](docs/features/multi-query-rag.md) | *[User pastes 500-char test report]* "What failed and why?" | ❌ Vaguely related chunks — Long input → averaged embedding → matches nothing specifically | ✅ Multi-query decomposition |
| [**comparison-queries**](docs/features/comparison-queries.md) | "Compare React vs Vue performance" | ❌ Incomplete comparison — Only retrieves one entity, missing the other | ✅ Multi-entity retrieval |
| [**entity-graph**](docs/features/entity-graph.md) | "What else mentions AuthService?" | ❌ Isolated chunks — No awareness of shared entities across docs | ✅ Entity-based chunk linking |
| [**temporal-queries**](docs/features/temporal-queries.md) | "What changed between Q1 and Q2?" | ❌ Random chunks — No awareness of time periods in query | ✅ Temporal query handling |
| [**aggregation-queries**](docs/features/aggregation-queries.md) | "List all the test cases that failed" | ❌ Partial list — No mechanism for comprehensive retrieval | ✅ Aggregation query handling |
| [**freshness-authority**](docs/features/freshness-authority.md) | "What does the official spec say?" | ❌ Returns notes — Can't distinguish authoritative vs informal sources | ✅ Freshness/authority boosting |
| [**query-expansion**](docs/features/query-expansion.md) | "How do I fetch the db config?" | ❌ No matches — User says "fetch", docs say "retrieve"; "db" vs "database" | ✅ Query expansion |
| [**query-rewriting**](docs/features/query-rewriting.md) | "Tell me more about it" *(after discussing TechCorp)* | ❌ Lost context — Pronouns like "it" reference nothing, retrieval fails | ✅ Conversational context resolution |
| [**hyde**](docs/features/hyde.md) | "What's TechCorp's approach to sustainability?" | ❌ Poor recall — Abstract queries don't embed close to concrete documents | ✅ Hypothetical document generation |
| [**code-aware-chunking**](docs/features/code-aware-chunking.md) | "How does the auth module work?" *(code)* | ❌ Broken code fragments — Naive chunking splits functions mid-body | ✅ Complete functions |
| [**contextual-embeddings**](docs/features/contextual-embeddings.md) | "When does it expire?" | ❌ Ambiguous chunk — "It expires in 24h" embedded without context; "it" = ? | ✅ Summary-prefixed embeddings |
| [**reranking**](docs/features/reranking.md) | "What's the battery warranty?" | ❌ Imprecise ranking — Vector similarity ≠ true relevance; best answer buried | ✅ Cross-encoder precision |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These features are **always on**—no configuration needed. Fitz automatically detects when to use each capability.

### Governance — Know What You Don't Know

[Feature docs](docs/features/governance-benchmarking.md) • [Benchmark results](docs/evaluation/fitz-gov-3.0-results.md) • [Classifier experiments](docs/evaluation/classifier/NOTEPAD.md)

Most RAG systems hallucinate confidently. Fitz **measures and enforces** epistemic honesty using a two-stage ML classifier trained on 1,100+ labeled cases from [fitz-gov](https://github.com/yafitzdev/fitz-gov), a benchmark for epistemic honesty.

| **DISPUTED** | Sources contradict each other        | **89.7%** |
| **TRUSTWORTHY** | Consistent, sufficient evidence      | **70.6%** |

<br>

> [!NOTE]
> Governance asks "given three relevant documents that partially contradict each other, should you flag a dispute, hedge the answer, or trust the consensus?" That's a judgment call even humans disagree on. 92% of our test cases are rated "hard."

<strong>The system fails safe 🛡️</strong>
> The safety-first threshold is tuned so that when the classifier is wrong, it over-hedges ("disputed" instead of "trustworthy") — annoying but harmless. Over-confidence ("trustworthy" instead of "disputed") is the rarest error mode: only 3 cases in 1,100+.

<strong>These scores are a floor, not a ceiling 👣</strong>
> All benchmarks were measured using `qwen2.5:3b` — a 3B parameter local model. The governance constraints run on the fast-tier LLM to keep latency low. Stronger models produce better constraint signals, which feed better features into the classifier. Upgrading your chat provider should improve governance accuracy for free.

<strong>Zero extra latency ⏱️</strong>
> The constraints already run as part of the pipeline. The ML classifier just replaces hand-coded rules with a local sklearn model — inference takes microseconds, no additional API calls.

<summary><strong>📦 Plugin Generator</strong> → <a href="docs/PLUGINS.md">Plugin Development Guide</a></summary>

<br>

#### Generate plugins with AI 🤖

>Fitz can generate fully working plugins from natural language descriptions. Describe what you want, and fitz creates, validates, and saves the plugin automatically.
>
>```bash
>fitz plugin
>? Plugin type: chunker
>? Description: sentence-based chunker that splits on periods
>
>Generating...
>✓ Syntax valid
>✓ Schema valid
>✓ Plugin loads correctly
>✓ Functional test passed
>
>Created: ~/.fitz/plugins/chunking/sentence_chunker.py
>```
>
>The generated plugin is immediately usable—no manual editing required.

<br>

#### Supported plugin types

>| Type | Format | Description |
>|------|--------|-------------|
>| `llm-chat` | YAML | Connect to a chat LLM provider |
>| `llm-embedding` | YAML | Connect to an embedding provider |
>| `llm-rerank` | YAML | Connect to a reranking provider |
>| `retrieval` | YAML | Define a retrieval strategy |
>| `chunker` | Python | Custom document chunking logic |
>| `reader` | Python | Custom file format reader |
>| `constraint` | Python | Epistemic safety guardrail |

<br>

#### How it works

>1. **Prompt building**: Fitz loads existing plugin examples and schema definitions
>2. **Generation**: Your configured LLM generates the plugin code
>3. **Multi-level validation**: Syntax → Schema → Integration → Functional tests
>4. **Auto-retry**: If validation fails, fitz feeds the error back and retries (up to 3 attempts)
>5. **Save**: Working plugins are saved to `~/.fitz/plugins/`
>
>Generated plugins are auto-discovered by fitz on next run—no registration needed.

<br>

#### Example: Custom chunker

>```bash
>fitz plugin
>? Plugin type: chunker
>? Description: splits text by paragraphs, keeping code blocks intact
>
># Creates ~/.fitz/plugins/chunking/paragraph_chunker.py
>```
>
>```python
># Generated plugin is immediately usable
>fitz ingest ./docs --chunker paragraph_chunker
>```

>```
>
>The SDK provides:
>- Module-level functions matching CLI (`ingest`, `query`)
>- Auto-config creation (no setup required)
>- Full provenance tracking
>- Same honest RAG as the CLI
>
>For advanced use (multiple collections), use the `fitz` class directly:
>```python
>from fitz_ai import fitz
>
>physics = fitz(collection="physics")
>physics.ingest("./physics_papers")
>answer = physics.query("Explain entanglement")
>```

<br>

<summary><strong>📦 Real-World Usage</strong></summary>

<br>

Fitz is a foundation. It handles document ingestion and grounded retrieval—you build whatever sits on top: chatbots, dashboards, alerts, or automation.

<br>

<strong>Chatbot Backend 🤖</strong>

> Connect fitz to Slack, Discord, Teams, or your own UI. One function call returns an answer with sources—no hallucinations, full provenance. You handle the conversation flow; fitz handles the knowledge.
>
> *Example:* A SaaS company plugs fitz into their support bot. Tier-1 questions like "How do I reset my password?" get instant answers. Their support team focuses on edge cases while fitz deflects 60% of incoming tickets.

<br>

<strong>Internal Knowledge Base 📖</strong>

> Point fitz at your company's wiki, policies, and runbooks. Employees ask natural language questions instead of hunting through folders or pinging colleagues on Slack.
>
> *Example:* A 200-person startup ingests their Notion workspace and compliance docs. New hires find answers to "How do I request PTO?" on day one—no more waiting for someone in HR to respond.

<br>

<strong>Continuous Intelligence & Alerting (Watchdog) 🐶</strong>

> Pair fitz with cron, Airflow, or Lambda. Ingest data on a schedule, run queries automatically, trigger alerts when conditions match. Fitz provides the retrieval primitive; you wire the automation.
>
> *Example:* A security team ingests SIEM logs nightly. Every morning, a scheduled job asks "Were there failed logins from unusual locations?" If fitz finds evidence, an alert fires to the on-call channel before anyone checks email.

<br>

<strong>Web Knowledge Base 🌎</strong>

> Scrape the web with Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, or Playwright. Save to disk, ingest with fitz. The web becomes a queryable knowledge base.
>
> *Example:* A football analytics hobbyist scrapes Premier League match reports. After ingesting, they ask "How did Arsenal perform against top 6 teams?" or "What tactics did Liverpool use in away games?"—insights that would take hours to compile manually.

<br>

<strong>Codebase Search 🐍</strong>

> Fitz includes built-in AST-aware chunking for code bases. Functions, classes, and modules become individual searchable units with docstrings and imports preserved. Ask questions in natural language; get answers pointing to specific code.
>
> *Example:* A team inherits a legacy Django monolith—200k lines, sparse docs. They ingest the codebase and ask "Where is user authentication handled?" or "What API endpoints modify the billing table?" New developers onboard in days instead of weeks.
