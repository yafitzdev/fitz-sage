## [0.11.0] - 2026-03-21

### 🎉 Highlights

**7x Faster Queries** — Eliminated model swapping on local Ollama. Embed-first pipeline runs the tiny embed model first, then all chat calls use a single model tier with zero swaps. Query wallclock dropped from ~180s to ~27s on local hardware.

**Hybrid PDF Parser** — Replaced Docling (21 min for 113 pages) with pdfplumber + GLM-OCR hybrid parser (28s). Text pages parsed instantly via pdfplumber with font-size/bold heading detection; scanned pages routed to GLM-OCR.

**Retrieval Benchmarks** — Document retrieval eval (20 queries, 3 PDFs, 75% critical recall) and table row retrieval eval (20 queries, 3 CSVs) with automated scoring against ground truth.

### 🚀 Added

- **`QueryBatcher`** — batches analysis + detection into 1 LLM call, halving model-swap overhead (`9e09793`)
- **`RetrievalProfile`** — single dataclass unifying 3 fragmented retrieval trigger mechanisms (analysis weights, detection flags, config constants) (`a4a5943`)
- **Extended classification signals** — specificity, domain, answer_type, multi_hop as soft multipliers on retrieval behavior (`777e7fc`)
- **Hybrid PDF parser** (`glm_ocr.py`) — pdfplumber fast path + GLM-OCR fallback for scanned/image pages (`62c8ff7`)
- **Phase 1 content embedding** — embed `title + content[:2000]` immediately during parsing, skip 25-min LLM summary wait (`9552705`)
- **Document retrieval benchmark** (`doc_eval.py`) — 20 queries across IRS 1040, NIST AI RMF, RAG survey PDFs (`5069470`)
- **Table retrieval benchmark** (`table_eval.py`) — 20 queries testing full pipeline: table discovery → SQL generation → execution (`29cf080`)
- Roadmap doc for query intelligence pipeline (`9e09793`)

### 🚀 Performance

- **Embed-first pipeline** — embed query before chat calls so chat model loads once and stays loaded for entire pipeline (`a7904d2`)
- **Single chat tier** — map fast/balanced/smart all to `chat_balanced`, eliminating 5 model swaps per query on Ollama (`a7904d2`)
- **Combined SQL generation** — merged column selection + SQL gen into 1 LLM call in TableQueryHandler (`a7904d2`)
- **Rewrite-first dispatch** — rewrite query before classification for better analysis accuracy (`9e09793`)

### 🔄 Changed

- HyDE ownership moved to router only — removed from code_search and section_search strategies (`5069470`)
- Router `retrieve()` accepts `RetrievalProfile` instead of separate `analysis`/`detection` params (`a4a5943`)
- Deleted 4 static gating methods from router (`_should_run_hyde`, `_should_run_multi_query`, `_should_inject_corpus_summaries`, `_should_run_agentic`) — logic moved to `RetrievalProfile` (`a4a5943`)
- `parser` config option now supports `"glm_ocr"` in addition to `"docling"` and `"docling_vision"` (`62c8ff7`)
- TableQueryHandler uses single LLM call for SQL generation (removed separate column selection step) (`a7904d2`)

### 🔧 Fixed

- SQL prompt: added GROUP BY rule for aggregate queries (`29cf080`)
- SQL retry: feed actual PostgreSQL error messages to LLM instead of generic "Query execution failed" (`29cf080`)
- SQL prompt: added rule to include ORDER BY/WHERE columns in SELECT (`29cf080`)

---

## [0.10.4] - 2026-03-19

### 🔄 Changed

- **Removed LM Studio provider** — Ollama is the only local LLM provider. Simplifies the provider stack. fitz-graveyard has its own independent LM Studio implementation. (`2b07944`)
- Removed LM Studio from firstrun fallback chain, README, architecture diagram, docs (`2b07944`, `e5cde2d`)

### 🔧 Fixed

- **Single-file agentic search always uses the file** — when user points at exactly one file with `--source`, skip BM25 filtering and use it directly (`7b24a93`)

---

## [0.10.3] - 2026-03-19

### 🎉 Highlights

**Flat Config** — Single config file (`.fitz/config.yaml`) with flat `provider/model` keys. No nested `chat_kwargs`, no engine-specific config directory. `chat_fast: ollama/qwen3.5:0.6b` is the entire config for a chat tier. Auto-created on first run.

**Zero-Friction First Run** — `pip install fitz-ai` then `fitz query "Q" --source ./docs` just works. Auto-detects Ollama models, classifies into tiers, writes config. If models are missing, prompts to pull them. Fallback chain: Ollama → LM Studio → API keys → clear instructions.

**Lightweight Install** — `docling` moved to optional extra (`pip install fitz-ai[docs]`). Base install includes lightweight PDF/DOCX/PPTX parsers via pypdfium2, python-docx, python-pptx (~25MB instead of ~5GB).

**Simplified CLI** — Removed `fitz init`, `fitz config`, `fitz eval` from public CLI. Config is auto-created and users edit `.fitz/config.yaml` directly. Four commands remain: `query`, `collections`, `serve`, `reset`.

### 🚀 Added

- Flat config schema: `chat_fast`, `chat_balanced`, `chat_smart` replace `chat` + `chat_kwargs.models` (`37b6832`)

- Progress messages during engine init: "Starting database...", "Loading LLM models..." (`a8e6c71`)
- Actionable Ollama errors: 404 → "run `ollama pull X`", ConnectError → "run `ollama serve`" (`2c328d5`, `7f6df38`)
- `pytest_sessionstart` cleanup for zombie postgres processes on Windows (`0b3a95c`)

### 🔄 Changed

- Config: `embedding` default includes model (`ollama/nomic-embed-text`) (`37b6832`)
- Deleted `chat_kwargs`, `embedding_kwargs`, `rerank_kwargs`, `vision_kwargs` from schema (`37b6832`)
- Deleted `FitzPaths.engine_config()`, `config_dir()`, `ensure_config_dir()` (`37b6832`)
- `get_chat_factory()` accepts tier specs dict instead of single provider string (`37b6832`)
- SDK `_ensure_config()` uses first-run auto-detection instead of hardcoded Cohere template (`910c576`)
- `docling` moved from core dependency to `[docs]` extra (`a8e6c71`)

- Removed `fitz init`, `fitz config`, `fitz eval` CLI commands (`c60a57e`, `8c328c6`)
- All "run fitz init" messages replaced with "edit .fitz/config.yaml" (`c60a57e`)
- README: added prereqs line, FAQ section, removed inline fallback notes (`666fc87`, `4e4340c`)

### 🔧 Fixed

- Clean error message when Ollama not running (was raw WinError 10061 stacktrace) (`7f6df38`)
- Warning when PDF/DOCX files encountered without docling installed (`a8e6c71`)

### 📝 Docs

- Removed all `fitz init`/`fitz config`/`fitz eval` references from CLI.md, CONFIG.md, PLUGINS.md, FEATURE_CONTROL.md, TROUBLESHOOTING.md (`b905c8c`)
- README: LM Studio added as prerequisite option (`cd9cdc6`)
- README: CLI reference reduced to 4 commands with config note (`c60a57e`)
- FAQ covers: fitz not found, PDF support, Ollama errors, model changes, cloud providers, reset (`4e4340c`)

## [0.10.2] - 2026-03-12

### 🎉 Highlights

**Standalone Code Retrieval (`fitz-ai[code]`)** — New `fitz_ai/code/` module provides LLM-powered code retrieval without PostgreSQL, pgvector, or docling. Point at a directory, ask a question — CodeRetriever builds a structural index from AST, selects relevant files via LLM, expands via import graph and neighbor directories, and returns compressed results. Zero heavy dependencies.

**LlmCodeSearchStrategy Overhaul** — Rewrote the DB-backed code search strategy: FILE-level addresses instead of per-symbol, combined query expansion + file selection in one LLM call (better targeting), import graph expansion, neighbor directory expansion, and flat origin-based scoring (1.0/0.9/0.8). The combined prompt produces more targeted file selections by letting the LLM reason about expansion terms and files holistically.

**LM Studio Provider** — New `lmstudio` chat provider with multi-tier model support. Configure different models for fast/balanced/smart tiers via YAML.

**Actionable Governance Modes** — ABSTAIN and DISPUTED answers are now informative and solution-oriented instead of generic refusals. ABSTAIN explains what was searched, shows related topics that DO exist, and suggests documents to add. DISPUTED tells the LLM exactly which sources conflict so it can explain both perspectives specifically.

### 🚀 Added

- `fitz_ai/code/` standalone module: `CodeRetriever`, `indexer`, `prompts` (`f4ec70b`)
- `CodeRetriever` class: index → LLM select → import expand → neighbor expand → read → compress pipeline (`f4ec70b`)
- `build_file_list()`, `build_structural_index()`, `build_import_graph()` in `fitz_ai/code/indexer.py` (`f4ec70b`)
- `get_file_paths()` and `get_structural_index()` public accessors on `CodeRetriever` (`1ab902c`)
- Configurable `llm_tier` parameter on `CodeRetriever` — consumers choose which model tier does file selection (`010de5a`)
- `[code]` extras group in pyproject.toml for dependency documentation (`f4ec70b`)
- LM Studio chat provider with tier-based model selection (`d3ff5ce`)
- 20 unit tests for code retrieval (indexer, retriever, import graph, no-heavy-imports) (`f4ec70b`)
- **Actionable ABSTAIN** — ABSTAIN answers now explain why (governance reasons), show related corpus topics (via entity graph), and suggest what documents to add (`2196861`)
- **Actionable DISPUTED** — DISPUTED mode injects specific conflicting excerpts and source names into the LLM prompt so it explains both perspectives (`0ae9dc5`)
- `EntityGraphStore.find_related_topics()` for corpus gap analysis (`2196861`)
- `FitzKragEngine._build_gap_context()` and `_build_conflict_context()` for governance intelligence surfacing (`2196861`, `0ae9dc5`)
- Corpus Intelligence and KRAG Agent roadmap documents (`2196861`)
- Foundation file detection — auto-include files with >10 reverse imports (protocols, data models, enums) in code retrieval (`356b182`)
- Hub protection — hub files, foundation files, and scan hits can't be displaced by post-limit facade swap (`356b182`)
- Query-aware hub import ranking — hub imports ranked by keyword overlap with search terms instead of competing equally (`79232b9`)
- Retrieval quality benchmark with 40-query ground truth across 10 categories (`2c6eaee`)
- Eval tooling: auto-load LM Studio models, `limit`/`max_manifest_chars` params, A/B test scripts (`84a4406`)

### 🔄 Changed

- `CodeSynthesizer.generate()` accepts `gap_context` and `conflict_context` for actionable governance messages (`2196861`, `0ae9dc5`)
- Early "no addresses" ABSTAIN now sets `Answer.mode = AnswerMode.ABSTAIN` properly (`2196861`)
- `ConflictAwareConstraint` stores conflicting chunk excerpts in constraint metadata (`0ae9dc5`)
- Priority ordering updated: selected > hub core > foundation > hub imports > facade > import > neighbor (`caa4629`)
- Foundation files ranked by query keyword overlap, same as hub imports (`caa4629`)
- SDK: removed `ask()` alias — `query()` is the only method on the `fitz` class (`5de811b`)

### ⚡ Performance

- Combined query expansion + file selection in one LLM call (was two separate calls) — better targeting with fewer API calls (`3e7e827`)
- AST-based structural index with connection-weighted truncation — important files keep detail under budget (`f4ec70b`)
- Python compression via `compress_python()` reduces context size before LLM processing (`f4ec70b`)

## [0.10.0] - 2026-02-17

### 🎉 Highlights

**Progressive KRAG with Agentic Search** — Query any file or folder instantly without pre-ingestion. `fitz query --source ./docs "question"` parses documents on-demand, indexes in the background, and serves answers immediately. Agentic search discovers relevant files from a manifest, parses only what's needed, and retrieves with full KRAG intelligence.

**4-Question Cascade Governance Classifier** — Replaced the two-stage ML classifier with a 4-question cascade architecture: Q1 (evidence sufficient? ML) → Q2 (conflict? rule: ca_fired) → Q3 (conflict resolved? ML) → Q4 (evidence solid? ML). Achieves 79.1% accuracy with 90.0% abstain recall and 76.2% disputed recall. Model now ships with `pip install fitz-ai`.

**40% Pipeline Speedup** — Smart retrieval gating skips unnecessary LLM calls for simple queries, overlapped embedding fetches dimensions during component init, parallel strategy execution, and pre-warmed LLM/embedding models eliminate cold-start latency.

**CLI Simplification** — Slimmed CLI from 14 commands to 7. Consolidated `fitz point` and `fitz quickstart` into `fitz query --source`. Cleaner, more discoverable command surface.

### 🚀 Added

#### Progressive KRAG & Agentic Search
- `fitz query --source <path>` — Query files/folders without pre-ingestion
- On-demand PDF/DOCX/PPTX parsing with background indexing
- Agentic search: manifest-based file discovery, selective parsing, KRAG retrieval
- Pipeline timing breakdown in query output (parse, retrieve, generate times)
- Cached parsed PDF text to avoid redundant parsing
- Heading structure cache for rich documents (eliminates double parsing)

#### Governance Classifier Improvements
- 4-question cascade classifier (Q1→Q2→Q3→Q4) replacing two-stage architecture
- Text answer features: `query_subject_partial`, `entity_substantive_score`, `best_sentence_coverage`, `best_span_length`, `answer_span_coverage`
- Conflict quality features: `conflict_to_number_ratio`, `opposing_conclusion_count`, `negation_per_char`, `short_ctx_with_overlap`
- Interaction features: `ix_av_fires_good_overlap`, `ix_max_div_per_conflict`, `ix_single_chunk_denial`, `ix_ie_no_ca`, `ix_ca_no_ie`
- ~21 missing governance features added, InsufficientEvidence constraint re-enabled
- Numerical divergence features for cross-chunk analysis
- Safety-focused threshold calibration with vectorized sweep
- Model artifact shipped with package (`fitz_ai/governance/data/model_v6_cascade.joblib`)

#### Retrieval Intelligence
- Retrieval intelligence fully wired through KRAG pipeline
- Task-type embedding prefixes for improved retrieval quality
- Rewritten AV jury constraint: 3-fast + balanced confirmation

#### Performance Optimizations
- Smart retrieval gating: skip detection/analysis for simple queries
- Overlapped embedding: fetch `embed.dimensions` during component init (-1s startup)
- Parallel strategy execution with shared embeddings and pgserver sharing
- Pre-warm LLM and embedding models during engine init
- Skip analysis LLM call for simple queries (heuristic classification)
- Run query rewrite in parallel with analysis+detection
- Skip LLM selection for small manifests
- Warm smart tier sequentially after fast tier during init

#### Code Extraction Robustness
- Regex fallback for Python files with syntax errors (AST parse fails gracefully)
- Regex fallback for TypeScript/Java/Go when tree-sitter is unavailable

### 🔄 Changed

- **CLI surface**: Slimmed from 14 commands to 7 — removed `point`, `quickstart`, `chunk`, `db`, `engine`, `plugin`, `collections`
- **`fitz query --source`**: Consolidates `fitz point` and `fitz quickstart` into single command
- **Governance classifier**: Two-stage RF→ET replaced by 4-question cascade (Q1=0.62, Q3=0.56, Q4=0.51)
- **Governance data**: 199 "trustworthy-with-gap" cases relabeled to abstain in fitz-gov benchmark (context genuinely doesn't answer the question)
- **GovernanceDecider**: Model loaded exclusively from package directory (`fitz_ai/governance/data/`)

### 🔧 Fixed

- **InsufficientEvidence constraint**: Embedder was always `None` — now correctly passed at init
- **IE embedder API**: Fixed to use `.embed()` method instead of calling embedder directly
- **IE false ABSTAIN**: Fixed false abstain for lowercase proper nouns
- **Agentic search over-retrieval**: Fixed excessive chunk retrieval in single-chunk scenarios
- **Single-file source handling**: Fixed stale manifest accumulation
- **PDF content reading**: Fixed content extraction and suppressed noisy Docling/RapidOCR logs
- **Manifest management**: Re-add unchanged files to manifest after clear

- **Null chat response**: Handle gracefully instead of crashing

### 🧪 Testing

- Test suite overhaul: deleted stale tests, added E2E format coverage, added unit tests
- Fixed 26 test failures from PostgreSQL crash recovery hardening

### 🧹 Housekeeping

- Removed old governance models (v1-v7), eval results, and analysis scripts (~100MB freed)
- `*.joblib` added to package-data for model shipping

## [0.9.0] - 2026-02-12

### 🎉 Highlights

**KRAG Engine — Sole Engine Architecture** — The Knowledge Routing Augmented Generation (KRAG) engine replaces `fitz_rag` as the only engine. KRAG introduces multi-strategy query routing (code, section, table, chunk), multi-language code extraction (Python, TypeScript, Java, Go), and address-based retrieval with full expansion (references, imports, section context). The `fitz_rag` engine has been deleted entirely — no shims, no compatibility layer.

**Multi-Strategy Query Routing** — Queries are classified by `QueryAnalyzer` into types (code, documentation, data, cross, general) and routed to specialized retrieval strategies with weighted scoring. Each strategy searches a different index (symbol index, section index, table store, chunk store) and results are merged and ranked.

**Retrieval Robustness** — New `min_relevance_score` config field (default 0.15) filters out low-relevance results from vector search, preventing nonsense queries from polluting LLM context. Strategy calls are wrapped in try-except for graceful handling of missing tables on cloud tiers. Connection pool lifecycle management prevents pool exhaustion across tier switches.

### 🚀 Added

#### KRAG Engine (`fitz_ai/engines/fitz_krag/`)
- `FitzKragEngine` — Full `KnowledgeEngine` implementation with multi-strategy retrieval
- `QueryAnalyzer` — LLM-based query classification into code/documentation/data/cross/general types
- `QueryAnalysis` — Frozen dataclass with `strategy_weights` for weighted retrieval routing
- `RetrievalRouter` — Dispatches to code, section, table, chunk strategies and merges results
- `AddressExpander` — Expands retrieved addresses with references, imports, and section context
- `KRAGPipeline` — Full pipeline orchestration (analyze → route → expand → generate)

#### Multi-Language Code Extraction
- `PythonExtractor` — AST-based extraction of classes, functions, imports with relative import resolution
- `TypeScriptExtractor` — TypeScript/JavaScript class, function, interface extraction
- `JavaExtractor` — Java class, method, interface extraction
- `GoExtractor` — Go struct, function, interface extraction
- Symbol index for code-aware retrieval across all supported languages

#### Retrieval Robustness
- `min_relevance_score` config field — Filters addresses below threshold after ranking
- Graceful strategy failure handling — Missing tables/indices log warnings instead of crashing
- `PostgresConnectionManager.close_pool()` — Explicit pool cleanup to prevent connection exhaustion
- Pool cleanup on tier switch in e2e test runner

#### OllamaVision Provider
- `OllamaVision` — Local VLM provider for figure description during ingestion
- VLM parsing integration in KRAG ingestion pipeline

#### Guardrails & Governance Integration
- Guardrails (conflict-aware, insufficient-evidence, causal-attribution) integrated into KRAG
- Cloud cache integration for KRAG pipeline
- Shared detection system (`DetectionOrchestrator`) integrated into KRAG retrieval

### 🔄 Changed

- **Sole engine**: `fitz_krag` is now the only engine — all CLI, runtime, SDK, and API paths updated
- **`fitz init`**: Engine selection removed; KRAG plugin selection integrated
- **DATA query weights**: Rebalanced from `{table: 0.85, section: 0.05}` to `{table: 0.70, section: 0.15}` to prevent document-content queries from being misrouted to table strategy
- **DATA classification prompt**: Sharpened to distinguish explicit tabular operations from questions about facts/specifications that happen to involve numbers
- **pgvector dimension detection**: Now uses `format_type(atttypid, atttypmod)` returning strings like `"vector(384)"` instead of raw integer dimension queries, preventing dimension mismatch across embedding model changes
- **Governance thresholds**: Tuned to s1=0.55, s2=0.79 (15 critical cases)
- **Two-stage classifier**: Added support in eval pipeline
- **Test suite**: Security, chaos, load, and performance tests migrated from fitz_rag to KRAG API

### 🗑️ Removed

#### fitz_rag Engine (replaced by fitz_krag)
- `fitz_ai/engines/fitz_rag/` — Entire engine directory deleted
- `fitz_ai/engines/fitz_rag/retrieval/` — RAG pipeline, steps, strategies
- `fitz_ai/engines/fitz_rag/generation/` — RGS answer generation
- `fitz_ai/engines/fitz_rag/config/` — Engine configuration
- All `fitz_rag` imports, references, and CLI assumptions removed across codebase

#### Other Removals
- `LLMError` compatibility shim — Direct imports only
- `BasePluginConfig` / `PluginKwargs` duplicates — Extracted to `core/config.py`
- Governance guardrails moved from `core/` to shared `fitz_ai/governance/`

### 🔧 Fixed

- **Vector dimension mismatch**: pgvector now detects and prevents dimension mismatches when switching embedding models on an existing collection
- **Query misrouting**: Document-content queries (battery sizes, CEO names) no longer misclassified as DATA queries
- **CSV NULL handling**: Empty CSV cells stored as SQL NULL instead of empty string, fixing `IS NULL` queries
- **Connection pool exhaustion**: Pools explicitly closed when switching tiers, preventing PoolTimeout errors

- **Import paths**: Replace all `fitz_ai.engines.fitz_rag` imports with `fitz_ai.engines.fitz_krag`
- **Engine name**: Replace `engine="fitz_rag"` with `engine="fitz_krag"` in all API/SDK calls
- **Config files**: Engine config is now at `engines/fitz_krag/config/default.yaml`
- **No compatibility layer**: There are no shims or deprecation warnings — update all references

---

## [0.8.1] - 2026-02-09

### 🎉 Highlights

**ML Governance Classifier** — Replaced the hand-coded `AnswerGovernor` (37% accuracy) with a two-stage ML classifier: Random Forest (answerable vs abstain) → Extra Trees (trustworthy vs disputed). Trained on 1,113 fitz-gov cases with 51 features. Per-class recall: Abstain 81.2%, Disputed 89.7%, Trustworthy 70.6%. Only 3 dangerous (disputed→trustworthy) errors in 1,100+ cases.

**GovernanceDecider Integration** — New `GovernanceDecider` class wraps the ML classifier with fail-open fallback to `AnswerGovernor`. Loads the model artifact once at init and runs two-stage prediction with calibrated per-class thresholds (s1=0.50, s2=0.785).

**Safety-First Threshold Tuning** — Iterative threshold exploration prioritizing dispute detection safety. Sweet-spot at s2=0.785 balances trustworthy recall (70.6%) against disputed recall (89.7%) with minimal dangerous misclassifications.

### 🚀 Added

#### Governance ML Classifier
- Two-stage classifier pipeline: RF (Stage 1: answerability) → ET (Stage 2: conflict detection)
- `GovernanceDecider` class with fail-open fallback to `AnswerGovernor` on any error
- Calibrated per-class thresholds (s1=0.50, s2=0.785) tuned for safety
- 3-class output (abstain/disputed/trustworthy) mapped to 4-class AnswerMode (ABSTAIN/DISPUTED/CONFIDENT/QUALIFIED)
- Feature extraction pipeline: 51 features from constraint results, chunk metadata, and inter-chunk text signals
- Inter-chunk text features (hedging ratio, negation ratio, numeric density) — +10.5pp Stage 2 CV improvement

## [0.5.1] - 2026-01-11

### 🎉 Highlights

**ChunkEnricher - Unified Enrichment Bus** - All chunk-level enrichment (summary, keywords, entities) is now baked in and runs automatically via a unified enrichment bus. The `ChunkEnricher` batches ~15 chunks per LLM call, making enrichment nearly free (~$0.13-0.74 for 1000 chunks).

**Multi-Query RAG** - Long or complex queries are automatically expanded into multiple focused search queries. 

**Comparison queries** - ("X vs Y") are detected and expanded to ensure both entities are retrieved.

**Table Registry** - CSV/table files are now reliably retrieved via a table registry that stores chunk IDs at ingestion time. No more missed tables due to low semantic similarity.

  - Auto-collection creation on 404
  - Point format transformation (standard → provider-specific)
  - UUID conversion for DBs that require it (e.g., Qdrant)
  - Flexible auth (bearer, custom headers, optional)
  - Jinja2 templating for endpoints and request bodies
- **`available_vector_db_plugins()`** - lists all available plugins (both YAML and local)

### 🐛 Fixed
- **FAISS missing interface methods** - Added `list_collections()`, `get_collection_stats()`, `scroll()` to match vector DB contract
- **Rerank mock in tests** - Fixed `MockRerankEngine` to return `List[Tuple[int, float]]` instead of flat list

- CLI modules (`doctor.py`, `init.py`) now import from `fitz_ai.core.detect` instead of `fitz_ai.cli.detect`

## [0.3.0] - 2025-12-17

### 🎉 Overview

Fitz v0.3.0 transforms the project from a RAG framework into a **multi-engine knowledge platform**. This release introduces a pluggable engine architecture, the CLaRa engine for compression-native RAG, and a universal runtime for seamless engine switching.

### ✨ Highlights

- **Universal Runtime**: `run(query, engine="clara")` switch engines with one parameter
- **Engine Registry**: Discover, register, and manage knowledge engines
- **Protocol-Based Design**: Implement `answer(Query) -> Answer` to create custom engines
- **CLaRa Engine**: Apple's Continuous Latent Reasoning with 16x-128x document compression

### 🚀 Added

#### Core Contracts (`fitz_ai/core/`)
- `KnowledgeEngine` protocol for paradigm-agnostic engine interface
- `Query` dataclass for standardized query representation with constraints
- `Answer` dataclass for standardized response with provenance
- `Provenance` dataclass for source attribution
- `Constraints` dataclass for query-time limits (max_sources, filters)
- Exception hierarchy: `QueryError`, `KnowledgeError`, `GenerationError`, `ConfigurationError`

#### Universal Runtime (`fitz_ai/runtime/`)
- `run(query, engine="...")` universal entry point
- `EngineRegistry` for global engine discovery and registration
- `create_engine(engine="...")` factory for engine instances
- `list_engines()` to discover available engines
- `list_engines_with_info()` for engines with descriptions

#### CLaRa Engine (`fitz_ai/engines/clara/`)
- `ClaraEngine` full implementation of CLaRa paradigm
- `run_clara()` convenience function for quick queries
- `create_clara_engine()` factory for reusable instances
- `ClaraConfig` comprehensive configuration
- Auto-registration with global engine registry
- 17 passing tests covering all functionality

#### Fitz RAG Engine (`fitz_ai/engines/fitz_rag/`)
- `FitzRagEngine` wrapper implementing `KnowledgeEngine`
- `run_fitz_rag()` convenience function
- `create_fitz_rag_engine()` factory function
- Auto-registration with global engine registry

### 🔄 Changed

#### Public API (BREAKING)
- Entry points: `RAGPipeline.from_config(config).run()` → `run_fitz_rag()`
- Answer format: `RGSAnswer.answer` → `Answer.text`
- Source format: `RGSAnswer.sources` → `Answer.provenance`
- Chunk ID: `source.chunk_id` → `provenance.source_id`
- Text excerpt: `source.text` → `provenance.excerpt`

```

### 🐛 Fixed

- Resolved all circular import dependencies
- Fixed import path inconsistencies across modules
- Corrected Provenance field usage (score → metadata)
- Fixed engine registration order to prevent import errors
- Proper lazy imports in runtime to avoid circular dependencies

### 📚 Documentation

- Updated README with multi-engine architecture
- Added CLaRa hardware requirements
- Migration guide for v0.2.x → v0.3.0
- Updated all code examples

### 🧪 Testing

- All existing tests updated and passing
- 17 new tests for CLaRa engine (config, engine, runtime, registration)
- Tests use mocked dependencies (no GPU required for testing)
- Integration tests for engine protocol compliance

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

1. **Import paths changed**: Update all imports (see Migration Guide)
2. **Public API changed**: Use `run_fitz_rag()` or engine-specific functions
3. **Answer format changed**: `Answer.text` and `Answer.provenance`
4. **No backwards compatibility layer**: Clean break for cleaner codebase

### 📦 Dependencies

New optional dependencies:
```toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
clara = ["transformers>=4.35.0", "torch>=2.0.0"]
```
