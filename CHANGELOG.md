## [Unreleased]

## [0.16.1] - 2026-09-20

### 🚀 Added

- Added a deterministic, collection-local SQLite term graph for semantic query
  expansion. Foreground ingestion records source-backed abbreviations, explicit
  aliases and renames, mechanical identifier forms, error context, repeated
  phrases, and supported term relationships.
- Added explainable expansion traces containing the emitted term, relationship,
  matched source form, score, and supporting-document count.

### 🔄 Changed

- Replaced managed Qwen query expansion with the corpus term graph. Retrieval
  keeps the literal query, adds at most six ranked graph terms, and continues
  without expansion if the graph is unavailable.
- Background entity and hierarchy enrichment now runs only when a chat tier is
  explicitly configured. Standard ingestion and retrieval require no
  generative model.
- Removed the managed ONNX chat runtime and its model-specific dependency and
  configuration surface from the default installation.

### 🔧 Fixed

- Reindexing and deletion now retract a file's stale semantic forms,
  occurrences, and relationships before graph aggregates are rebuilt.
- Kept the graph sparse by restricting incidental phrase relationships and
  weak one-document error associations.
- Added indexed term-form lookup and bidirectional PascalCase identifier forms,
  including `AuthService` and `Auth Service`.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-08-08

### 🎉 Highlights

- **Searchable-first ingestion.** `point()` now parses and persists every
  supported changed file before returning. The SQLite/FTS5 source index is
  query-ready immediately afterward; optional entity, hierarchy, and summary
  enrichment continues independently and cannot make source evidence
  unavailable.
- **Broad recall with bounded precision work.** Literal query terms and managed
  Qwen semantic terms still fan out broadly through BM25, while the INT8 ONNX
  cross-encoder scores a bounded, profile-aware candidate window. Evidence
  closure retains access to the wider recall pool when a query contract is not
  yet covered.
- **One governance owner.** Pyrrho is now the sole authority for sufficiency,
  dispute, and insufficiency decisions. Fitz-Sage mechanically grows the ranked
  evidence prefix from three items in increments of two while Pyrrho returns
  `INSUFFICIENT`, without retrieval-side overrides or fallback verdicts.
- **Measured production boundaries.** The release adds reproducible folder,
  format, ingestion, recovery, BEIR, semantic-holdout, and enterprise retrieval
  evaluations, plus an explicit limitations contract. Known failures remain
  visible instead of being hidden behind a green aggregate score.

### 🚀 Added

- Added versioned `RetrievalRun` execution records with redacted-by-default
  JSON export, deterministic explanations, typed query/candidate/Pyrrho
  traces, and environment fingerprints.
- Added `--trace` and `--trace-content` retrieval controls, offline
  `fitz explain`, and Pyrrho-only `fitz replay` over integrity-checked frozen
  evidence. Equivalent capture, inspection, and replay APIs are available in
  the SDK.
- Added independent source-index and enrichment status. Unsupported files,
  source-index failures, enrichment failures, and query readiness now have
  distinct machine-readable states and concrete failure details.
- Added deterministic coverage tracking for explicit compound-query clauses
  and query-shape obligations. Missing source modalities and explicit bridges
  can request bounded evidence closure without a chat-generated retrieval loop.
- Added full-table typed execution for deterministic structured filters,
  including locally bound positive and negative boolean predicates.
- Added loopback-aware REST access control, API-key authentication for remote
  clients, configurable source-root boundaries, opt-in CORS origins, and strict
  collection-name validation.
- Added PEP 561 `py.typed` metadata for downstream type checkers.
- Added the 60-case limitations benchmark, focused `--case-id` runs,
  per-case progress, an 11-case required hardening gate, and a versioned
  `docs/LIMITATIONS.md` product contract.
- Added production folder suites covering distractors, reload stability, query
  shapes, and real PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, SQL, Go, Java, and TypeScript files.
- Added a selective, SHA-256-verified NapierOne ingestion benchmark with
  per-format throughput and storage metrics, idempotent re-point checks, and
  exact hard-crash recovery verification over unchanged external files.
- Added a checksum-verified BEIR retrieval benchmark over NFCorpus, FiQA, and
  SciFact with a transparent plain-BM25 baseline, graded ranking metrics,
  per-stage failure attribution, and exact query/Pyrrho trace retention.
- Added paired BEIR component ablations, reusable verified indexes, and a
  frozen semantic-vocabulary holdout so Qwen and reranker effects can be
  measured on queries not used during diagnosis.
- Added a frozen EnterpriseRAG-Bench holdout with deterministic corpus splits,
  literal-BM25 and component ablations, paired statistics, timing attribution,
  and explicit environment exclusions.
- Added production-readiness, searchable-indexing, retrieval-run, and
  evaluation documentation that separates package responsibilities from
  user-owned data preparation.

### 🔄 Changed

- `point()` is now the only source-indexing boundary. It scans, hashes, parses,
  stores typed retrieval units, updates FTS5, resolves imports, and then
  returns; it no longer waits for Qwen-backed enrichment.
- Background work is now explicitly enrichment, not indexing. The hidden
  worker command is `fitz enrichment-daemon`, manifests track indexing and
  enrichment separately, and unchanged files keep their searchable index.
- Document-side semantic alias generation was removed from ingestion. Source
  terms are indexed literally; managed Qwen semantic expansion remains at
  query time, where it broadens BM25 recall without silently rewriting corpus
  data.
- The product contract now explicitly leaves OCR recovery, raw-log
  compression, corpus cleanup, private acronym mappings, and identifier
  equivalence to the user. Fitz-Sage does not normalize variants such as
  `ATX-123`, `ATX_123`, and `ATX 123` into one value.
- Ordinary phrases and keywords no longer act as hard evidence filters.
  Exact identifiers remain strict anchors, while semantic and lexical
  candidates can survive to reranking and evidence compilation.
- Removed filesystem-recency and inferred source-authority ranking boosts.
  Temporal requests are handled from query and document content rather than
  treating a recently modified file as the newest fact.
- Evidence compilation now preserves raw retrieved content and historical
  sources instead of focusing paragraphs, rewriting evidence, or suppressing
  older facts.
- Bounded cross-encoder work independently from BM25 recall. Narrow,
  moderate, and broad profiles now score 24, 32, and 48 candidates by
  default, while evidence closure scores 16 and contract rescue logic keeps
  access to the full recall pool.
- The shipped INT8 reranker now uses two concurrent batch-one forward passes,
  exact input deduplication, and a bounded hash-keyed score cache without
  reducing its 512-token input limit.
- Cold long-document reranking now uses the section heading plus one
  query-relevant excerpt instead of repeating the generated fallback prefix,
  and reranker traces record scoring sizes instead of adding duplicate copies
  of the recalled source text.
- ONNX encoder and Qwen runtime sessions are shared across collections, while
  retrieval state is request-local so independent queries can execute
  concurrently.
- Collection indexing and enrichment writers now coordinate through a
  collection-scoped cross-process lock. Queries remain concurrent readers of
  the WAL-backed SQLite stores.
- Table retrieval now plans typed predicates and executes them against the
  complete SQLite table instead of inferring answers from a bounded preview.
  Concrete matched rows are included in reranker input.
- Explicit clause fanout and evidence compilation now preserve coverage across
  multi-part and comparison requests instead of allowing one strong clause to
  displace the rest.
- Pyrrho is now consumed directly as a pinned managed ONNX model, like the
  reranker and Qwen. The accidental external `pyrrho` Python dependency was
  removed; Fitz-Sage owns model loading, artifact validation, and mechanical
  head decoding while the model supplies the learned governance judgment.
- Fitz-Sage now passes unchanged ranked evidence prefixes to Pyrrho in a
  deterministic `3, 5, 7, ...` sequence. Exact `SUFFICIENT` or `DISPUTED`
  stops delivery; exact `INSUFFICIENT` adds two more up to `top_k`/`top_read`.
- Retrieval-run schema 2.0 records the selected stopping prefix and exact final
  Pyrrho input and decision; `EvidencePack` metadata also records the evaluated
  prefix trajectory. Replay evaluates the frozen stopping prefix.
- Bare `governance: pyrrho` now uses Pyrrho's accepted default model at an
  immutable commit, and Pyrrho outcomes remain separate from Fitz-Sage
  retrieval metrics.
- `fitz retrieve` is now the sole evidence command, `fitz answer` is the sole
  optional synthesis command, and the REST/SDK surfaces use the same explicit
  evidence-versus-answer split.
- Supported Python versions are now declared as 3.10 through 3.12.

### 🔧 Fixed

- Exact table identifiers are looked up across the full SQLite table instead
  of only the bounded scan prefix.
- Boolean table filters now understand general prefix negation and bind
  polarity to the nearest field/value expression instead of leaking `not`
  across unrelated clauses.
- Long documents without headings are split into bounded searchable sections
  instead of becoming one oversized retrieval unit.
- Code files with no finer extractable symbols now retain a
  filename-addressable module retrieval unit instead of being reported as
  unsearchable.
- Identifier evidence now matches qualified symbols such as
  `module.Class.method` without weakening exact identifier boundaries.
- Evidence closure now derives bridges from compiler-selected evidence and no
  longer replaces precise table rows merely because a follow-up has closure
  metadata.
- Reranking now uses a bounded query-centered excerpt so literal facts late in
  long or headingless documents can influence ranking without rewriting source
  text.
- Evidence closure can follow explicit query-bound source definitions such as
  `QRS means Queue Recovery Service` without inventing or persisting aliases.
- Clear structured record/property requests perform a bounded row scan, and
  evidence compilation preserves one rare literal BM25 anchor where possible.
- Table row retrieval now gives the reranker a bounded preview of the concrete
  rows BM25 or deterministic filtering already matched, rather than only the
  table schema.
- Comparison table results and evidence for separate compound-query clauses
  now survive closure and final evidence selection.
- Table closure is scoped to each concrete bridge request, and explicit code
  file bridges can resolve to symbols defined inside the referenced file.
- Temporal benchmark cases retain historical sources in the evidence pack
  instead of treating their presence as forbidden retrieval.
- Qwen semantic generation now has bounded output, validates the keyword-list
  contract, and falls back to literal retrieval when generation is malformed
  instead of aborting the query.
- Demand-summary failures are persisted as retryable enrichment failures rather
  than being silently marked complete.
- Table-ingestion failures now retain their concrete parse, read, or SQLite
  storage cause while reporting collection-relative paths instead of leaking
  absolute source paths.
- Optional or unsupported formats are reported explicitly instead of being
  counted as successful empty documents.
- Evidence closure now skips modalities absent from the physical collection,
  isolates each follow-up to request-local terms and its target strategy, and
  records every skip in the retrieval trace.
- Section BM25 now ranks lightweight FTS row IDs before materializing only the
  winning source rows, avoiding full-content joins across large match sets
  without changing result order.
- Documentation now names the managed model that shipped with this release
  rather than the deferred Qwen3.5 0.8B target.

### 🗑 Removed

- Removed built-in synonym/acronym dictionaries, identifier-separator
  normalization, hard-coded code-search synonym mappings, and domain-specific
  table rules. No compatibility aliases were retained.
- Removed Fitz-Sage's governance provider implementation, evidence-prefix
  cutoff, local verdict overrides, and associated compatibility surfaces.
- Removed the duplicate `fitz query` CLI alias and ambiguous synthesis
  `query()` helpers. Use `fitz retrieve` / `evidence()` for evidence and
  `fitz answer` / `answer()` for optional synthesis.
- Removed the REST `/query` synthesis alias and `FitzService.query()`. Use
  `/answer` and `FitzService.answer()`.
- Removed the optional chat-generated multi-hop controller, agentic-search
  strategy, and Pyrrho-gated retrieval loop. Contract-driven evidence closure
  remains deterministic and runs before one fixed submission to Pyrrho.
- Removed document-side semantic keyword enrichment and its parsed-cache path;
  source indexing now writes directly to the canonical typed stores.
- Removed the unused generic chunking/plugin registry, duplicate tabular query
  and extraction stack, legacy source-discovery and core registries, and stale
  CLI context/UI helpers. Retrieval uses the engine's actual section, symbol,
  and SQLite table implementations directly.
- Removed obsolete `enable_multi_hop`, `max_hops`, `enable_citations`, and
  engine-local `log_level` configuration fields.
- Removed the obsolete `tools/cli_map` package, which depended on deleted CLI
  internals.
- Removed the standalone fixed-evidence Pyrrho benchmark. Direct governance
  model evaluation belongs to Pyrrho; Fitz benchmarks retain only live
  integration outcomes alongside retrieval metrics.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-07-08

### 🎉 Highlights

**Retrieval-first fitz-sage, with `EvidencePack` as the user contract.**
The default product surface is now `fitz query "..."`: point it at a folder,
or run it from a folder, and it returns governed evidence instead of a
generated answer. `fitz answer` remains the explicit optional synthesis path
for users who configure an OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

**Broad recall → ONNX rerank → Pyrrho cutoff.** Query execution now
optimizes for high-recall candidate gathering first, lets the local ONNX
cross-encoder impose precision, then asks Pyrrho whether the top-1,
top-2, ... evidence prefix is enough to answer.

**New Pyrrho v2 nano g1 wired end-to-end.** Fitz now uses
`yafitzdev/pyrrho-v2-nano-g1` as the canonical governance model. The default
model uses the new v2 heads: `evidence_verdict`, `failure_mode`,
`retrieval_intents`, and `evidence_kinds`.

**Managed Qwen enrichment is standard.** The release-default Qwen ONNX model
is the required local runtime for semantic query keywords and ingestion
enrichment. It is downloaded when missing and is not exposed as an
optional user flag.

**Governance quality now has fixed-evidence and live retrieval gates.** The
release adds governance-specific benchmark runners and balanced sufficiency /
insufficiency / dispute checks for the v2 model.

### 🚀 Added

- **One-command query UX** — `fitz query "question"` now defaults to the
  current directory when no `--source` or `--collection` is provided,
  registers the source, waits only for the parsed search surface, and
  returns the best governed evidence while deeper indexing continues.
- **Staged progressive indexing** — collections move through queryable
  states (`PARSED`, `KEYWORDED`, `ENTITY_LINKED`, `HIERARCHY_READY`,
  `ENRICHED`, `SUMMARIZED`) instead of blocking the first query on every
  enrichment phase.
- **Background indexing daemon** — keyword/entity/hierarchy enrichment can
  continue after the foreground query returns, so follow-up queries benefit
  from a richer index without requiring an explicit ingest command.
- **Canonical retrieval pipeline docs** —
  `docs/RETRIEVAL_PIPELINE.md` now documents the query cases, strategy
  roles, and flowcharts for partial and fully indexed collections.
- **Pyrrho evidence metadata in CLI output** — evidence tables now expose
  the governance verdict, cutoff, probabilities, and reasons without a
  separate awkward metadata box.
- **Native Pyrrho v2 metadata** — evidence responses now expose the v2
  verdict, failure mode, retrieval intents, and evidence-kind heads directly.
- **Pyrrho package loader for v2** — the governance runtime can load the
  released v2 sequence-classification package as the default local CPU model.
- **New Pyrrho v2 head shape** — governance metadata now follows the
  `evidence_verdict`, `failure_mode`, `retrieval_intents`, and
  `evidence_kinds` heads from the released v2 model.
- **Governance benchmark runner** — `benchmarks.fitz_bench.governance_runner`
  evaluates fixed evidence cases without retrieval noise.

### 🔄 Changed

- **Pyrrho loading now supports the v2 package shape.** The default package is
  the v2 native sequence classifier; older multitask packages can still load
  when explicitly configured.
- **Governance metadata follows the new Pyrrho heads.** Runtime metadata uses
  the v2 head names from the released model package.
- **Structured lookup keeps code retrieval eligible.** When Pyrrho says a
  query is a structured lookup, code search remains available even if the
  wording also mentions tables or sections.
- **Pyrrho retry metadata follows the configured package.** Runtime retry
  behavior reads the metadata supplied by the selected Pyrrho model.
- **ONNX encoder loading handles external data sidecars.** Split ONNX
  exports such as `model_quantized.onnx` + `model_quantized.onnx.data`
  now load through the shared encoder backend.
- **ONNX encoder loading can fall back to `tokenizer.json`.** Hub repos
  whose tokenizer config names an unavailable wrapper still load through
  `PreTrainedTokenizerFast` when they ship a standard tokenizer JSON.
- **Pyrrho uses Fitz's managed model cache.** Configured Pyrrho checkpoints
  download into `~/.fitz/models/pyrrho/...`, avoiding Windows Hugging Face
  symlink-cache failures.
- **First-run config aligns with the product defaults.** Auto-created
  configs now write `parser: cpu`, `rerank: onnx`, and
  `governance: pyrrho`; `rerank: null` and `governance: null` are rejected
  outside test-only internals.
- **CLI/docs/examples now distinguish evidence from synthesis.**
  `query`/`retrieve` are retrieval/evidence commands; `answer` is the
  optional generated-answer command.
- **`fitz query` keeps the no-flags UX.** Endpoint/model/API-key flags live on
  `fitz answer`, while `fitz query` remains the minimal retrieval surface.

### 🔧 Fixed

- **Qwen enrichment JSON hardening** — required enrichment now repairs or
  rejects malformed model output with clearer errors instead of silently
  corrupting the index.
- **Qwen enrichment fail-closed fallback** — if the managed Qwen enrichment
  runtime returns invalid JSON twice for one file, ingestion logs the failure
  and falls back to deterministic grounded keywords/entities from the item
  text instead of blocking the collection forever.
- **Partial-corpus evidence consistency** — broad-corpus queries now align
  progress messages and evidence counts, avoid scanning fitz workspace
  files as user sources, and keep source-query rows from outranking real
  corpus evidence.
- **Corpus summary hygiene** — stale synthetic `__corpus_summary__` rows are
  versioned, deleted before regeneration, and excluded from ordinary BM25
  section hits. Corpus summaries now enter retrieval only through the explicit
  broad-overview injection path.
- **Supplemental scan noise** — the CLI only reports the supplemental scan when
  the manifest actually has files below query-ready state.
- **Metric comparison cutoff** — Pyrrho cutoff now seeds comparison prefixes
  with direct metric/table evidence, so `Q1 vs Q2 total responses` selects both
  exact metric rows before stopping instead of stopping on weaker prose.
- **Comparison evidence cutoff with code identifiers** — exact function-style
  identifiers such as `query_profile_metadata` and `_format_query_profile` now
  match raw evidence as identifiers, not as loose word bags, so Pyrrho
  `answer_now` cannot certify a comparison after retrieving only one side.
- **Private Python identifier lookup** — structured lookup now recognizes
  leading-underscore names such as `_format_query_profile` while avoiding
  natural hyphenated prose such as `pre-retrieval` as a hard identifier.

### 🗑 Removed

- **No llama.cpp / GGUF fallback path.** Managed Qwen enrichment is ONNX-only
  for a smaller, simpler runtime contract.

## [0.14.1] - 2026-06-01

### 🚀 Added

- **`RetrievalEngine` protocol** (`fitz_sage.RetrievalEngine`) — extends
  `KnowledgeEngine` with the ingest/retrieve lifecycle (`load`, `point`,
  `wait_for_indexing`, `retrieve`, `indexing_status`). External consumers can now
  type `create_engine()` results against a contract that advertises retrieval, not
  just `answer()`.
- **Complete `fitz` SDK** — the SDK holds one collection-bound engine and exposes
  the full lifecycle: `point()`, `query()`, `retrieve()`, `wait_for_indexing()`,
  `indexing_status()`. No need to drop to `create_engine` for raw retrieval.
- **REST ingestion + status** — `POST /collections/{name}/documents` registers
  documents (background indexing; `202` + status) and `GET /collections/{name}/status`
  reports progress, instead of ingestion being a side-effect of `/query`.
- **`metadata` on REST query/chat responses** — surfaces `Answer.metadata`
  (notably `gap_context` on `ABSTAIN`) at the HTTP boundary.

### 🗑 Removed

- **`top_k` query parameter** and the **`Constraints` type** — both were accepted
  across the SDK/REST surface but ignored by the engine (it derives the retrieval
  limit from the retrieval profile and never read `query.constraints`). Removed
  rather than wired, for a smaller user surface; the internal retrieval-profile
  `top_k` is unchanged.
- **Dead `init`/`config` CLI modules** — `fitz init`/`fitz config` were already
  gone from the public CLI; this deletes the orphaned modules plus the old
  `core/detect.py` they used (first-run config lives in `core/firstrun.py`).
- **`StructuredLogger`** — logging unified onto the standard library. `get_logger`
  now returns a `logging.Logger`; per-query correlation moved to a stdlib `Filter`
  (`set_query_context`), and the CLI now actually calls `configure_logging()`.
- **Dead code + duplication sweep** — orphaned plugin registries, pre-v0.12
  config/timeout scaffolding, the unused `Source` discovery layer, the dead
  streaming-chat path, and ~25 unreferenced methods. Deduplicated LLM-JSON parsing,
  retrieval scoring, KRAG store helpers, the tree-sitter scaffold, and the tabular
  SQL/file-reader paths. Net ~2,950 lines removed; tests + `contract_map` green.

### 🔄 Changed

- **Docs and examples refreshed for the current SDK/config surface.** Examples now
  show `fitz.query(..., source=...)`, the engine-scoped
  `~/.fitz/config/fitz_krag.yaml` config path, the `cpu` parser default, and
  provider-controlled governance/VLM behavior.
- **`contract_map` validates the live architecture contract directly.** It now
  distinguishes module-level edges from lazy imports, supports optional import
  dependencies, renders local role rules, and adds `--fail-on-errors` for CI/release
  gating.

### 🔧 Fixed

- **CORS** — `allow_credentials=False` with the `*` origin (browsers reject the
  wildcard+credentials combination; the API is unauthenticated).
- **Stale CLI guidance** — the "documents required" hint printed a nonexistent
  `engine.add_documents(...)`; it now shows the real `engine.point(...)`.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-05-17

### 🎉 Highlights

**Multi-hop retrieval is on by default.** Retrieval is now one
`RetrievalPass` (retrieve → rerank → read) that the multi-hop controller
loops, gated by the pyrrho classifier instead of a per-hop chat call. A
single hop stays the common case, and the cross-encoder reranker now
runs on every query — multi-hop used to skip it.

**Dropped `optimum` → dropped `torch` (~2 GB).** The pyrrho governance
classifier and the gte-reranker cross-encoder now run on raw
`onnxruntime` instead of `optimum.onnxruntime`. `optimum 2.x`
hard-depends on `torch`, which the pre-built-INT8-ONNX load path never
needs — so `pip install fitz-sage` was dragging in ~2 GB of PyTorch
for nothing. Both encoders load the pre-quantized `.onnx` straight
from the model repo with `huggingface_hub` and run it through an
`onnxruntime.InferenceSession`. Verified torch-absent: pyrrho `decide()`
warm ~11 ms, reranker `rerank()` warm ~17 ms.

### 🚀 Added

- **`retrieval_workers` config field** (`FitzKragConfig`, default `4`).
  Caps how many retrieval strategies run concurrently. Set it to `1` to
  serialize LLM calls for single-model local servers (LM Studio,
  llama-server).
- **Semantic keyword recall leg.** The query-prep call now emits a
  keyword set — LLM-generated semantic keywords fused with deterministic
  dictionary synonyms/acronyms (`expand_terms`) — and the retrieval
  router runs it as an extra BM25 leg. Without embeddings, BM25 alone
  misses vocabulary the user did not type; the keyword leg closes that
  first-stage recall gap on short, lexically-disjoint queries.

### 🗑 Removed

- **Five dead packages**, orphaned by the embeddings / vector-DB / Cloud
  removals — no product code imported them: `fitz_sage/structured/` (the
  old vector-DB-era SQL/table stack, superseded by `tabular/`),
  `fitz_sage/plugin_gen/` (plugin scaffolding generator),
  `fitz_sage/backends/` (Ollama-era local runtime, with its `local`
  extra), `fitz_sage/core/http.py` (generic/Cohere HTTP client), and
  `fitz_sage/llm/transforms.py` (Cohere/Anthropic/Ollama chat
  transforms).
- **Semantic hierarchy grouping.** The embedding-based clustering path —
  `semantic_grouper.py`, `embedding_provider.py`, and the
  `grouping_strategy` / `n_clusters` / `max_clusters` config knobs — is
  deleted. It had been unreachable and broken since embeddings were
  removed in v0.12.0; hierarchy grouping is metadata-key only
  (`group_by`).
- **`connection_string` config field** — a leftover from the Postgres
  era; SQLite storage has no connection string.
- **Standalone `QueryRewriter`** (class + `_needs_rewriting` skip
  heuristic + its prompt), the router's separate `_expand_query`
  multi-query LLM call, and the `EXPANSION` detection category
  (`ExpansionDetector`). Rewriting and keyword expansion are now sections
  of the one query-prep call; multi-query is the rewrite section's
  compound-query decomposition.
- **Config fields `enable_multi_query` and `multi_query_min_length`** —
  multi-query is no longer length-gated or separately toggled.

### 🔧 Fixed

- **Reranker now genuinely runs INT8 ONNX.** v0.13.0 loaded the
  reranker with `ORTModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
  model_id, export=True)` — which exports **FP32** ONNX from the
  PyTorch checkpoint on the fly, (a) ignored the pre-built quantized
  ONNX the model repo already ships, and (b) required `torch` to do
  the export (and `torch` was not a declared dependency — a fresh
  install + first rerank call could crash). The CHANGELOG + docs
  claimed "INT8 ONNX". Now `OnnxReranker` loads the pre-built
  `onnx/model_int8.onnx` (151 MB) that
  `Alibaba-NLP/gte-reranker-modernbert-base` publishes — genuine INT8.

- **First-run config no longer offers dead LLM providers.**
  `core/registry.py`'s `_LLM_PROVIDER_CAPABILITIES` still advertised the
  removed `cohere` / `anthropic` / `ollama` providers and an `embedding`
  capability, so the first-run provider selection presented a menu with
  non-functional options. Corrected to the live set — `endpoint` /
  `openai` / `azure_openai` / `enterprise`.

### 🔄 Changed

- **Query prep collapsed into one batched LLM call.** Rewrite, analysis,
  detection, and the new keyword section run as sections of a single
  always-on `QueryBatcher` call — replacing the previous separate
  (heuristically-gated) rewrite call plus the (gated) analysis/detection
  call. Rewriting always runs now; the `_needs_rewriting` skip-heuristic
  is gone. The Step-0 query-length cap was raised 500 → 8000 so long
  pasted queries reach decomposition instead of being clipped first.

- **Code retrieval consolidated onto KRAG.** Removed the standalone
  `fitz_sage/code/` `CodeRetriever`; `FitzKragEngine` now exposes a public
  `retrieve()` method — the retrieval half of `answer()`, usable without
  synthesis. The `[code]` extra is gone.

- **v0.13.02 dead-code audit cleanup.** Alongside the code-retrieval
  consolidation: unified the LLM-JSON parser that was duplicated three
  times (plus two inline copies) into `core/json_utils.parse_llm_json`;
  unified the duplicated `httpx` client builder into `_build_http_client`;
  renamed the mislabeled `_pg_table_store` → `_sqlite_table_store` (it was
  always a `SqliteTableStore`); removed dead code — `IngestionVectorError`
  (exported, never raised) and the unused `RetrievalStrategy` protocol;
  and dropped stale `vector-database` / `embeddings` keywords and the
  `embeddings` pytest marker from `pyproject.toml`.

- **`fitz_sage/governance/pyrrho.py`** + **`fitz_sage/llm/providers/onnx_reranker.py`** —
  rewrote both load paths: `huggingface_hub.hf_hub_download` to fetch
  the pre-built `.onnx`, `onnxruntime.InferenceSession` to run it,
  `transformers.AutoTokenizer` for tokenisation. No `optimum` import
  anywhere.
- **`OnnxReranker`** gained `onnx_subfolder` / `onnx_file` constructor
  params so a custom `model_id` can point at wherever that repo keeps
  its pre-built ONNX. There is no longer a torch-backed `export=True`
  fallback — if the named ONNX can't be fetched, `_load()` raises a
  clear error (pick a model that ships ONNX).
- **Dependencies:** dropped `optimum[onnxruntime]`; added `onnxruntime`
  and `huggingface-hub` as explicit direct deps. `transformers` stays
  (tokeniser only — torch is an optional extra of transformers and is
  no longer pulled). `TRANSFORMERS_VERBOSITY=error` is set before the
  tokenizer import to silence the benign "no DL framework found"
  advisory.
- **Extracted `OnnxEncoderBackend`** (`fitz_sage/encoders/onnx.py`) — a
  shared base class for the local INT8 ONNX encoders. `pyrrho.py` and
  `onnx_reranker.py` were duplicating the lock-guarded lazy load,
  `hf_hub_download` + `InferenceSession` setup, and tokenizer wiring
  line for line; that path now lives once in `OnnxEncoderBackend`.
  `Pyrrho` and `OnnxReranker` are thin subclasses that own only their
  tokenizer call shape and logit post-processing. `OnnxReranker`'s
  constructor + public surface are unchanged.
- **`enable_guardrails` → `governance` (provider-presence config).** The
  `enable_guardrails: bool` flag is replaced by `governance: <spec> | null`,
  matching the `rerank` / `vision` / `parser` pattern. `governance: pyrrho`
  (default) enables the classifier; `governance: null` disables it;
  `governance: pyrrho/<hf-model-id>` selects a custom pyrrho fine-tune.
  A config still using `enable_guardrails` gets an actionable error from
  the loader pointing at the replacement. The engine builds the classifier
  through a new `governance.create_governance()` factory; the module-level
  `governance.decide()` wrapper + its process-wide singleton are gone — the
  engine owns a config-built `Pyrrho` instance.
- **Retrieval stack unified into one `RetrievalPass`.** Tiers 1-4 of
  retrieval — candidate generation, cross-strategy fusion, precision
  rerank, read — were duplicated: the engine ran them inline for
  single-hop queries while `KragHopController` ran its own copy (minus
  reranking) for multi-hop. They are now one `RetrievalPass` unit
  (`engines/fitz_krag/retrieval/retrieval_pass.py`) — the engine runs it
  once, the hop controller loops it. The cross-encoder reranker
  consequently runs on **every** query, multi-hop included (multi-hop
  previously bypassed it).
- **Multi-hop is on by default** (`enable_multi_hop: true`) and free of
  the per-hop sufficiency chat call. `KragHopController` no longer asks a
  chat model "is this enough?" after each hop — it reads the pyrrho
  verdict: `TRUSTWORTHY`/`DISPUTED` -> stop, `ABSTAIN` -> bridge question
  + another pass. A single hop stays the common case; the added cost on
  the default path is one ~30 ms ONNX pyrrho call, no chat call.
- **Removed the dead `multi_hop` query signal.** The LLM-detected
  `multi_hop` extended signal (in `query_batcher`'s prompt and
  `RetrievalProfile`) never affected routing and is redundant now that
  pyrrho gates hops — dropped from both.

### 📝 Docs

- **Documentation sync.** Audited the full `docs/` tree against the
  v0.12 / v0.13 architecture and corrected ~30 files: removed references
  to deleted internals (`CodeRetriever`, the constraint cascade,
  `VectorSearchStep`, vector DB / embeddings), documented the new public
  `FitzKragEngine.retrieve()` API, fixed stale config and CLI-command
  docs, and deleted the obsolete `framework-integrations` doc. The
  retrieval feature docs were further updated for the one-call query-prep
  refactor.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-05-15

### 🎉 Highlights

**Two encoder swaps. The retrieval + governance pipeline is now
fully local CPU.**

1. **Governance is [pyrrho](https://huggingface.co/yafitzdev/pyrrho-modernbert-base-v1)
   now.** The constraint+sklearn cascade is gone. Every
   `(query, retrieved contexts)` pair runs through a single INT8 ONNX
   forward pass over the ModernBERT-base pyrrho fine-tune and returns
   one of `TRUSTWORTHY` / `DISPUTED` / `ABSTAIN` in ~30 ms on CPU.
2. **Reranking is an ONNX cross-encoder now.** The chat-call-based
   `LLMReranker` is gone. Reranking runs locally via
   [`Alibaba-NLP/gte-reranker-modernbert-base`](https://huggingface.co/Alibaba-NLP/gte-reranker-modernbert-base) —
   a 149M-parameter ModernBERT cross-encoder served as INT8 ONNX
   through `optimum.onnxruntime`. ~30–100 ms CPU for 10–20 candidates.

Both encoders share the same `optimum`/`transformers`/INT8 ONNX
toolchain. After this release the chat endpoint is only used for
query rewriting, multi-query decomposition, detection, and the
synthesizer.

**Governance swap (pyrrho replaces the cascade):**

| Metric                  | Cascade (v0.12.x) | Pyrrho v1 (v0.13.0) | Δ        |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- | -------- |
| Overall accuracy        | 78.7%             | **86.13%**          | +7.43 pp |
| False-trustworthy rate  | 5.7%              | **5.27%**           | -0.43 pp |
| Wall-clock per decision | ~500–2000 ms      | **~30 ms**          | ~50x     |
| External LLM calls      | 4–5               | **0**               | —        |

**Reranker swap (ONNX cross-encoder replaces `LLMReranker`):**

| Metric                  | LLMReranker (v0.12.x) | OnnxReranker (v0.13.0)              |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Per-query reranker cost | 1 chat call           | 1 ONNX forward pass                 |
| CPU latency (10–20 docs)| ~500–2000 ms          | ~30–100 ms                          |
| External dependency     | chat endpoint         | none (local, cached)                |
| Ranking quality         | model-dependent       | matches 1.2B `nemotron-rerank` on Hit@1 |

Net code change in `fitz_sage/`: **-6,254 lines** (-12% of production
code). Combined with v0.12.0 we're at **-20,805 lines vs v0.11.0**
(-30%).

### 🚀 Added

- **`fitz_sage/governance/pyrrho.py`** — single-pass governance
  classifier. `decide(query, contexts) -> GovernanceDecision`,
  lazy-loaded INT8 ONNX, calibrated `TAU = 0.50` fallback on
  low-confidence `TRUSTWORTHY` predictions.
- **`fitz_sage/llm/providers/onnx_reranker.py`** — `OnnxReranker`.
  Lazy-loads tokenizer + INT8 ONNX `SequenceClassification` model via
  `optimum.onnxruntime`. Batched forward over `(query, doc)` pairs;
  returns `RerankResult` list sorted by score desc. Accepts any HF
  cross-encoder via `OnnxReranker(model_id=...)`.
- New rerank spec **`onnx`** (default) and **`onnx/<hf-model-id>`** in
  `create_rerank_provider`. Examples:
  - `rerank: onnx` → `gte-reranker-modernbert-base`
  - `rerank: onnx/BAAI/bge-reranker-base`
  - `rerank: onnx/jinaai/jina-reranker-v3`
  - `rerank: onnx/cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`
- **Runtime deps:** `transformers>=4.50`, `optimum[onnxruntime]>=1.20`,
  `numpy>=1.26` (numpy was implicit via downstream deps; now explicit).

### 🗑 Removed

**Governance cascade (-6,316 lines):**

- `fitz_sage/governance/decider.py` — `GovernanceDecider` and the 4-question cascade orchestrator
- `fitz_sage/governance/governor.py` — `AnswerGovernor`, `decide_answer_mode`
- `fitz_sage/governance/constraints/` (entire subtree):
  - `plugins/conflict_aware.py`, `insufficient_evidence.py`, `causal_attribution.py`, `specific_info_type.py`, `answer_verification.py`
  - `semantic.py` (`SemanticMatcher` + the unused embedder slot)
  - `feature_extractor.py` (108-feature extraction over chunks + chat outputs)
  - `aspect_classifier.py`, `numerical_detector.py`, `staged.py`, `runner.py`, `base.py`
- `fitz_sage/governance/data/model_v6_cascade.joblib` — the trained sklearn cascade artifact
- `tools/governance/` — feature extraction + cascade training scripts
- `CONSTRAINT_REGISTRY` and the constraint plugin discovery path from `fitz_sage/core/registry.py`
- Constraint plugin generator template + plugin type (`fitz_sage/plugin_gen/templates/constraint/`, `PluginType.CONSTRAINT`)
- Tests for the removed surface: `test_governance.py`, `test_governance_decider.py`, `test_constraints.py`, `test_constraint_runner.py`, `test_staged_pipeline.py`, `test_causal_attribution.py`, `test_krag_guardrails.py`, `tests/integration/test_governance_{constraints,pipeline}.py`

**LLM reranker:**

- `fitz_sage/llm/providers/llm_reranker.py` — `LLMReranker` and
  the chat-call-based reranker. Its tests (`tests/unit/llm/test_llm_reranker.py`)
  were removed alongside it.
- `"llm"` rerank spec — no longer accepted. The engine-layer
  shortcut in `FitzKragEngine` that special-cased `"llm"` is gone;
  all rerank providers now flow through `create_rerank_provider`.

### 🔄 Changed

- **`FitzKragConfig.enable_guardrails`** still toggles governance; default unchanged (`True`). When `True`, the engine calls `pyrrho.decide()` between retrieval and generation. When `False`, all answers are `TRUSTWORTHY`.
- **`FitzKragConfig.rerank` default**: `"llm"` → `"onnx"`. Existing configs that explicitly set `rerank: "llm"` will fail to load with an actionable error message. Migration: change to `rerank: onnx`.
- **Default config** (`fitz_krag/config/default.yaml`) reflects the new rerank default + updated comments.
- **`fitz_sage/llm/providers/__init__.py`** — exports `OnnxReranker` (was `LLMReranker`). Optional import so static tooling on a fresh checkout still works without `optimum` installed.
- **`HierarchyEnricher`** dropped its `semantic_matcher` parameter (was unused since v0.12.0). Same for `assess_chunk_group(chunks)` — no more `semantic_matcher=` kwarg.
- **`engine.py`** simplification: `_build_conflict_context` removed; `DISPUTED` cases now feed the synthesizer a single-key reason dict from `GovernanceDecision.reason`. ABSTAIN-mode gap context unchanged. Reranker setup dropped the two-branch shim — one code path now: `get_reranker(spec)`.
- **Docs swept end-to-end**: `CONSTRAINTS.md` (rewritten around pyrrho), `CONFIG.md`, `CONFIG_EXAMPLES.md`, `FEATURE_CONTROL.md`, `PLUGINS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `ENGINES.md`, `features/platform/krag.md`, `features/platform/openai-compatible-endpoint.md`, `features/platform/enterprise-gateway.md`, `features/retrieval/reranking.md` (rewritten), `sparse-search.md`, `multi-query-rag.md`, `features/ingestion/{code-symbol-extraction, hierarchical-rag}.md`, `evaluation/beir-results.md`. Governance-benchmarking doc marked historical. README architecture diagram now shows local CPU encoders alongside the chat provider.

### 🔧 Fixed

- `fitz_sage/core/registry.py`: removed broken `CONSTRAINT_REGISTRY` reference + `get_constraint_plugin` / `available_constraint_plugins` accessors. The constraint plugin scan path (`fitz_sage.governance.constraints.plugins`) was already dead after deletion; removing it tidies up the registry.

### Migration from v0.12.x

```yaml
# old
rerank: llm

# new (default — faster + local)
rerank: onnx

# or pin a different cross-encoder
rerank: onnx/BAAI/bge-reranker-base
```

No code changes required for consumers of `FitzKragEngine` or the
public `get_reranker` API — the `RerankProvider` protocol is
unchanged. First call to `rerank()` and `decide()` downloads the
respective HF model (cached under `~/.cache/huggingface/`) and
lazy-loads it via `optimum.onnxruntime`.

---

## [0.12.0] - 2026-05-14

### 🎉 Highlights

**Storage swap** — PostgreSQL is gone; SQLite + FTS5 is the only
storage. One `.db` file per collection, zero install, stdlib only.
Drops `psycopg`, `psycopg-pool`, `fitz-pgserver` from deps. The
865-line `PostgresConnectionManager` becomes a ~200-line file-based
`SqliteConnectionManager`.

**Embeddings removed.** The entire embedding pipeline — provider
protocol, retrieval-side `embed_batch` calls, HyDE, contextual
embeddings, chunk-fallback, vector columns — is gone. Retrieval is
now BM25 (native FTS5 `bm25()`) + KRAG typed-unit routing + an LLM
reranker that scores documents in a single chat call. No vector DB,
no embedding model, no second network protocol. Validated on
fitz-gov v5 — the chat-only stack matches or beats the prior hybrid
on the metrics that matter.

**Single chat protocol.** OpenAI-compatible HTTP is the only chat
path. `endpoint` is the canonical provider; `openai`, `azure_openai`,
`enterprise` are presets over it. Legacy `cohere`, `anthropic`,
`ollama` provider names removed (raise `ValueError` with migration
text). Ollama still works — point `chat_base_url` at
`http://localhost:11434/v1`.

Smoke baseline preserved: 5/5 answered, 6/6 substrings, 3/5
governance mode-match.

### 🗑 Removed

- **`fitz_sage/storage/postgres.py`** — 865-line PostgreSQL connection manager (`8fa36a57`)
- **`fitz_sage/cloud/`** + **`fitz_sage/integrations/`** — Fitz Cloud cache client + LangChain/LlamaIndex adapter wrappers (`c4ab1138`)
- **`fitz_sage/evaluation/`** — governance decision logger + BEIR/RGB/fitz_gov benchmarks (postgres-coupled) (`8fa36a57`)
- **`fitz_sage/cli/commands/eval.py`** + **`reset.py`** — `fitz eval` and pgserver reset commands (`8fa36a57`, `c4ab1138`)
- **`fitz_sage/retrieval/sparse/`** — dead code that queried a `chunks` table deleted in the vector_db demolition (`8fa36a57`)
- **`fitz_sage/vector_db/`** + every plugin in it — vector-DB abstraction and pgvector backend (`bdca80ae`)
- **Embedding API** — `OpenAICompatEmbedding`, the `Embedder` provider protocol, `get_embedder()`, all per-provider embedding implementations, ingestion-side `embed_batch` calls, and the `embedding:` config key (`c7dc48a1`, `23fb8606`, `39e6ac02`, `b936b45d`)
- **HyDE** (`fitz_sage/retrieval/hyde/`) — hypothetical document generation; pointless without embeddings (`65ad6962`)
- **ChunkFallbackStrategy** — fell back to dense chunk search when typed-unit retrieval missed; obsolete in chat-only mode (`65ad6962`)
- **Contextual embeddings module** — summary-prefixed embeddings for disambiguation (`c7dc48a1`)
- **DiffIngestExecutor** surface — the embedding-aware ingest orchestrator; KRAG's own ingest pipeline took over (`65ad6962`)
- **Legacy chat providers** — `cohere`, `anthropic`, `ollama` per-vendor implementations. Passing these names raises `ValueError` with migration text pointing at `endpoint` + `chat_base_url` (`c7dc48a1`)
- **`FitzKragConfig.cloud` field** + engine `_cloud_client` / `_check_cloud_cache` / `_store_cloud_cache` / `_build_cache_versions` / `CLOUD_OPTIMIZER_VERSION` (`c4ab1138`)
- **`retrieval_mode` config flag** — was the transitional toggle between hybrid and chat-only modes; chat-only is now the only mode (`b936b45d`)
- **Postgres-specific tests:** `test_postgres_{connection,recovery,table_store}.py`, `test_evaluation.py`, `test_beir_benchmark.py`, `tests/integration/test_cloud_cache_e2e.py`, `tests/unit/integrations/`, `tests/manual/` (`8fa36a57`, `c4ab1138`)
- **Deps:** `psycopg`, `psycopg-pool`, `fitz-pgserver` (storage); `pgvector`, `faiss-cpu` (vector DB); `langchain-core`, `llama-index-core` extras (`8fa36a57`, `c4ab1138`, `bdca80ae`)

### 🔄 Changed

- **Storage backend** — PostgreSQL → SQLite. New `SqliteConnectionManager` with WAL mode + `foreign_keys=ON`; one `.db` per collection under `<workspace>/sqlite/` (`8fa36a57`)
- **Retrieval pipeline** — embeddings + RRF over dense/sparse → pure FTS5 `bm25()` + KRAG typed-unit routing + LLM reranker. The reranker speaks the same OpenAI-compatible chat protocol as the synthesizer; no separate cross-encoder backend (`b936b45d`, `c7dc48a1`)
- **Chat protocol** — per-vendor SDK paths consolidated into `OpenAICompatChat`. `endpoint` is canonical; `openai`, `azure_openai`, `enterprise` are configuration presets. Per-tier overrides (`chat_smart_base_url`, `chat_smart_model`, `chat_smart_api_key_env`) let you mix local and cloud (`c7dc48a1`, `969bfb43`)
- **CLI overrides** — `fitz query --endpoint <URL> --model <name> --api-key-env <VAR>` lets users point at any OpenAI-compatible server without editing config (`969bfb43`)
- **Retrieval ranking** — FTS5 `MATCH` + native `bm25()` replaces `tsvector @@ to_tsquery` + `ts_rank` (`8fa36a57`)
- **Schema port** — `JSONB` → `TEXT` + JSON1; `TEXT[]` → JSON arrays + `json_each`; `ILIKE` → `LIKE COLLATE NOCASE`; `unnest(columns)` → `json_each(columns)`; `%s` → `?` (`8fa36a57`)
- **Collection lifecycle** — `list_collections` scans `glob fitz_*.db`; `delete_collection` is `os.unlink` (was `DROP DATABASE` against admin DB) (`8fa36a57`)
- **`PostgresTableStore` → `SqliteTableStore`** — dynamic per-CSV table model preserved; LLM SQL prompts updated to SQLite syntax (`8fa36a57`)
- Stores ported to SQLite: `RawFileStore`, `SymbolStore`, `SectionStore`, `ImportGraphStore`, `TableStore`, `VocabularyStore`, `EntityGraphStore` (`8fa36a57`)

### 🔧 Fixed

- **`SqliteConnectionManager` deadlock**: class-level `_lock` was a non-reentrant `threading.Lock`, so `reset_instance()` → `stop()` (which also takes the lock) deadlocked from the same thread. Switched to `threading.RLock`.
- **Unit-test singleton cascade**: the ~25 failures in `test_vocabulary` / `test_krag_guardrails` / `test_section_store` / `test_krag_engine` were caused by `test_krag_detection` and `test_krag_engine` patching `SqliteConnectionManager` without resetting the singleton afterward; the MagicMock leaked into later tests. Both files now apply the opt-in `reset_sqlite_singleton` fixture via module-level `pytestmark = pytest.mark.usefixtures(...)`.
- **`test_krag_engine` stale-postgres patch**: `PostgresTableStore` import path no longer exists post-Cloud-removal; the engine constructs `SqliteTableStore` instead. Updated the patch target.
- **`test_section_store` BM25 sign**: the test fed a positive raw `bm25()` value but production code negates the FTS5 result (FTS5 returns lower-better; downstream wants higher-better). Test input flipped to negative so the assertion matches reality.
- **`test_cli_endpoint_flags` ANSI brittleness**: linux CI runners render typer/rich help with embedded color escapes that split `--endpoint` into `-` + `-endpoint`, breaking the substring assertion. Test now strips ANSI before matching.
- **CI workflow stale-postgres steps**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` had a "Run postgres tests (Linux only)" step that selected zero tests post-Cloud-removal (exit code 5). Removed it, dropped the now-pointless `-m "not postgres"` filter, and pruned `fitz-pgserver` / `psycopg` / `psycopg-pool` / `faiss-cpu` from the pip install lists. `mutation.yml` dropped its `--ignore=tests/unit/test_postgres_recovery.py` for a file that no longer exists.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-03-21

### 🎉 Highlights

**Local/Cloud Optimization** — Local Ollama automatically maps all chat tiers to `chat_balanced` (one model, zero VRAM swaps). Cloud providers use all three tiers as configured (no swap cost with APIs).

**Hybrid PDF Parser** — Replaced Docling (21 min for 113 pages) with pdfplumber + GLM-OCR hybrid parser (28s). Text pages parsed instantly via pdfplumber with font-size/bold heading detection; scanned pages routed to GLM-OCR.

**Retrieval Benchmarks** — Document retrieval eval (20 queries, 3 PDFs, 75% critical recall) and table row retrieval eval (20 queries, 3 CSVs) with automated scoring against ground truth.

### 🚀 Added

- **`QueryBatcher`** — batches analysis + detection into 1 LLM call, halving model-swap overhead (`9e09793`)
- **`RetrievalProfile`** — single dataclass unifying 3 fragmented retrieval trigger mechanisms (analysis weights, detection flags, config constants) (`a4a5943`)
- **Extended classification signals** — specificity, domain, answer_type, multi_hop as soft multipliers on retrieval behavior (`777e7fc`)
- **Hybrid PDF parser** (`glm_ocr.py`) — pdfplumber fast path + GLM-OCR fallback for scanned/image pages (`62c8ff7`)
- **Phase 1 content embedding** — embed `title + content[:2000]` immediately during parsing, skip 25-min LLM summary wait (`9552705`)
- **Document retrieval benchmark** (`doc_eval.py`) — 20 queries across IRS 1040, NIST AI RMF, RAG survey PDFs (`5069470`)
- **Table retrieval benchmark** (`table_eval.py`) — 20 queries testing full pipeline: table discovery → SQL generation → execution (`29cf080`)
- Roadmap doc for query intelligence pipeline (`9e09793`)

### 🚀 Performance

- **Local/cloud tier split** — local ollama: all tiers → `chat_balanced` (zero VRAM swaps); cloud: use configured fast/balanced/smart (`8130ddd`)
- **Parallel embed + classify** — embed runs in parallel with batch classify since embed model + chat model both fit in VRAM (`a73a22b`)
- **Single chat tier on local** — map fast/balanced/smart all to `chat_balanced`, eliminating 5 model swaps per query on Ollama (`a7904d2`)
- **Combined SQL generation** — merged column selection + SQL gen into 1 LLM call in TableQueryHandler (`a7904d2`)
- **Rewrite-first dispatch** — rewrite query before classification for better analysis accuracy (`9e09793`)
- **Eliminated double SQL execution** — table handler reuses validated SQL result instead of executing twice (`3f483ba`)

### 🔄 Changed

- HyDE ownership moved to router only — removed from code_search and section_search strategies (`5069470`)
- Router `retrieve()` accepts `RetrievalProfile` instead of separate `analysis`/`detection` params (`a4a5943`)
- Deleted 4 static gating methods from router (`_should_run_hyde`, `_should_run_multi_query`, `_should_inject_corpus_summaries`, `_should_run_agentic`) — logic moved to `RetrievalProfile` (`a4a5943`)
- `parser` config option now supports `"glm_ocr"` in addition to `"docling"` and `"docling_vision"` (`62c8ff7`)
- TableQueryHandler uses single LLM call for SQL generation (removed separate column selection step) (`a7904d2`)

### 🔧 Fixed

- SQL prompt: added GROUP BY rule for aggregate queries (`29cf080`)
- SQL retry: feed actual PostgreSQL error messages to LLM instead of generic "Query execution failed" (`29cf080`)
- SQL prompt: added rule to include ORDER BY/WHERE columns in SELECT (`29cf080`)
- Removed dead `_text_to_elements` and `_parse_json_list` methods (`3f483ba`)

### 🧪 Tests

- Rewrote performance/load tests to measure harness overhead, not hardware-dependent LLM speed
- Removed absolute latency/throughput thresholds — tests now check relative metrics (degradation ratio, memory stability)
- Reduced tier 4 answer() calls from 96 to 36 (~9 min instead of 60+ min)
- Updated chaos tests to mock synthesizer chat (pipeline no longer calls `_query_analyzer.analyze`)

### 📝 Docs

- Rewrote CONFIG.md for flat `provider/model` config format
- Updated 12 docs: removed `plugin_name`/`kwargs`, `fitz_krag.yaml`, `local_ollama`, `fitz init` references

---

## [0.10.4] - 2026-03-19

### 🔄 Changed

- **Removed LM Studio provider** — Ollama is the only local LLM provider. Simplifies the provider stack. fitz-graveyard has its own independent LM Studio implementation. (`2b07944`)
- Removed LM Studio from firstrun fallback chain, README, architecture diagram, docs (`2b07944`, `e5cde2d`)

### 🔧 Fixed

- **Single-file agentic search always uses the file** — when user points at exactly one file with `--source`, skip BM25 filtering and use it directly (`7b24a93`)

---

## [0.10.3] - 2026-03-19

### 🎉 Highlights

**Flat Config** — Single config file (`.fitz/config.yaml`) with flat `provider/model` keys. No nested `chat_kwargs`, no engine-specific config directory. `chat_fast: ollama/qwen2.5:3b` is the entire config for a chat tier. Auto-created on first run.

**Zero-Friction First Run** — `pip install fitz-sage` then `fitz query "Q" --source ./docs` just works. Auto-detects Ollama models, classifies into tiers, writes config. If models are missing, prompts to pull them. Fallback chain: Ollama → LM Studio → API keys → clear instructions.

**Lightweight Install** — `docling` moved to optional extra (`pip install fitz-sage[docs]`). Base install includes lightweight PDF/DOCX/PPTX parsers via pypdfium2, python-docx, python-pptx (~25MB instead of ~5GB).

**Simplified CLI** — Removed `fitz init`, `fitz config`, `fitz eval` from public CLI. Config is auto-created and users edit `.fitz/config.yaml` directly. Four commands remain: `query`, `collections`, `serve`, `reset`.

### 🚀 Added

- Flat config schema: `chat_fast`, `chat_balanced`, `chat_smart` replace `chat` + `chat_kwargs.models` (`37b6832`)
- First-run auto-detection: Ollama model discovery via `/api/tags`, tier classification by parameter size (`2c328d5`)
- Interactive model pull prompt when Ollama has no suitable models (`2c328d5`)
- Fallback chain: Ollama → LM Studio → Cohere/OpenAI API keys → clear error (`2c328d5`)
- "Ollama installed but not running" detection via PATH binary check (`666fc87`)
- Lightweight PDF parser (pypdfium2) with heading heuristics (`a6c0063`)
- Lightweight DOCX parser (python-docx) with structural parsing (`a6c0063`)
- Lightweight PPTX parser (python-pptx) with slide/title extraction (`a6c0063`)
- FAQ/Troubleshooting section in README (`4e4340c`)
- Config file guard on `fitz serve` — refuses to start without config, gives instructions (`25dadd7`)
- Progress messages during engine init: "Starting database...", "Loading LLM models..." (`a8e6c71`)
- Actionable Ollama errors: 404 → "run `ollama pull X`", ConnectError → "run `ollama serve`" (`2c328d5`, `7f6df38`)
- `pytest_sessionstart` cleanup for zombie postgres processes on Windows (`0b3a95c`)

### 🔄 Changed

- Config: single file `.fitz/config.yaml` replaces `.fitz/config.yaml` + `.fitz/config/fitz_krag.yaml` (`37b6832`)
- Config: `embedding` default includes model (`ollama/nomic-embed-text`) (`37b6832`)
- Deleted `chat_kwargs`, `embedding_kwargs`, `rerank_kwargs`, `vision_kwargs` from schema (`37b6832`)
- Deleted `FitzPaths.engine_config()`, `config_dir()`, `ensure_config_dir()` (`37b6832`)
- `get_chat_factory()` accepts tier specs dict instead of single provider string (`37b6832`)
- SDK `_ensure_config()` uses first-run auto-detection instead of hardcoded Cohere template (`910c576`)
- `docling` moved from core dependency to `[docs]` extra (`a8e6c71`)
- Parser router falls back to lightweight parsers when docling not installed (`a6c0063`)
- Removed `fitz init`, `fitz config`, `fitz eval` CLI commands (`c60a57e`, `8c328c6`)

## [0.10.2] - 2026-03-12

### 🎉 Highlights

**Standalone Code Retrieval (`fitz-sage[code]`)** — New `fitz_sage/code/` module provides LLM-powered code retrieval without PostgreSQL, pgvector, or docling. Point at a directory, ask a question — CodeRetriever builds a structural index from AST, selects relevant files via LLM, expands via import graph and neighbor directories, and returns compressed results. Zero heavy dependencies.

**LlmCodeSearchStrategy Overhaul** — Rewrote the DB-backed code search strategy: FILE-level addresses instead of per-symbol, combined query expansion + file selection in one LLM call (better targeting), import graph expansion, neighbor directory expansion, and flat origin-based scoring (1.0/0.9/0.8). The combined prompt produces more targeted file selections by letting the LLM reason about expansion terms and files holistically.

**LM Studio Provider** — New `lmstudio` chat provider with multi-tier model support. Configure different models for fast/balanced/smart tiers via YAML.

**Actionable Governance Modes** — ABSTAIN and DISPUTED answers are now informative and solution-oriented instead of generic refusals. ABSTAIN explains what was searched, shows related topics that DO exist, and suggests documents to add. DISPUTED tells the LLM exactly which sources conflict so it can explain both perspectives specifically.

### 🚀 Added

- `fitz_sage/code/` standalone module: `CodeRetriever`, `indexer`, `prompts` (`f4ec70b`)
- `CodeRetriever` class: index → LLM select → import expand → neighbor expand → read → compress pipeline (`f4ec70b`)

## [0.10.0] - 2026-02-17

### 🎉 Highlights

**Progressive KRAG with Agentic Search** — Query any file or folder instantly without pre-ingestion. `fitz query --source ./docs "question"` parses documents on-demand, indexes in the background, and serves answers immediately. Agentic search discovers relevant files from a manifest, parses only what's needed, and retrieves with full KRAG intelligence.

**4-Question Cascade Governance Classifier** — Replaced the two-stage ML classifier with a 4-question cascade architecture: Q1 (evidence sufficient? ML) → Q2 (conflict? rule: ca_fired) → Q3 (conflict resolved? ML) → Q4 (evidence solid? ML). Achieves 79.1% accuracy with 90.0% abstain recall and 76.2% disputed recall. Model now ships with `pip install fitz-sage`.

**40% Pipeline Speedup** — Smart retrieval gating skips unnecessary LLM calls for simple queries, overlapped embedding fetches dimensions during component init, parallel strategy execution, and pre-warmed LLM/embedding models eliminate cold-start latency.

**CLI Simplification** — Slimmed CLI from 14 commands to 7. Consolidated `fitz point` and `fitz quickstart` into `fitz query --source`. Cleaner, more discoverable command surface.

### 🚀 Added

#### Progressive KRAG & Agentic Search
- `fitz query --source <path>` — Query files/folders without pre-ingestion
- On-demand PDF/DOCX/PPTX parsing with background indexing
- Agentic search: manifest-based file discovery, selective parsing, KRAG retrieval
- Pipeline timing breakdown in query output (parse, retrieve, generate times)
- Cached parsed PDF text to avoid redundant parsing
- Heading structure cache for rich documents (eliminates double parsing)

#### Governance Classifier Improvements
- 4-question cascade classifier (Q1→Q2→Q3→Q4) replacing two-stage architecture
- Text answer features: `query_subject_partial`, `entity_substantive_score`, `best_sentence_coverage`, `best_span_length`, `answer_span_coverage`
- Conflict quality features: `conflict_to_number_ratio`, `opposing_conclusion_count`, `negation_per_char`, `short_ctx_with_overlap`
- Interaction features: `ix_av_fires_good_overlap`, `ix_max_div_per_conflict`, `ix_single_chunk_denial`, `ix_ie_no_ca`, `ix_ca_no_ie`
- ~21 missing governance features added, InsufficientEvidence constraint re-enabled
- Numerical divergence features for cross-chunk analysis
- Safety-focused threshold calibration with vectorized sweep
- Model artifact shipped with package (`fitz_sage/governance/data/model_v6_cascade.joblib`)

#### Retrieval Intelligence
- Retrieval intelligence fully wired through KRAG pipeline
- Task-type embedding prefixes for improved retrieval quality
- Rewritten AV jury constraint: 3-fast + balanced confirmation

#### Performance Optimizations
- Smart retrieval gating: skip detection/analysis for simple queries
- Overlapped embedding: fetch `embed.dimensions` during component init (-1s startup)
- Parallel strategy execution with shared embeddings and pgserver sharing
- Pre-warm LLM and embedding models during engine init
- Skip analysis LLM call for simple queries (heuristic classification)
- Run query rewrite in parallel with analysis+detection
- Skip LLM selection for small manifests
- Warm smart tier sequentially after fast tier during init

#### Code Extraction Robustness
- Regex fallback for Python files with syntax errors (AST parse fails gracefully)
- Regex fallback for TypeScript/Java/Go when tree-sitter is unavailable

### 🔄 Changed

- **CLI surface**: Slimmed from 14 commands to 7 — removed `point`, `quickstart`, `chunk`, `db`, `engine`, `plugin`, `collections`
- **`fitz query --source`**: Consolidates `fitz point` and `fitz quickstart` into single command
- **Governance classifier**: Two-stage RF→ET replaced by 4-question cascade (Q1=0.62, Q3=0.56, Q4=0.51)
- **Governance data**: 199 "trustworthy-with-gap" cases relabeled to abstain in fitz-gov benchmark (context genuinely doesn't answer the question)
- **GovernanceDecider**: Model loaded exclusively from package directory (`fitz_sage/governance/data/`)

### 🔧 Fixed

- **InsufficientEvidence constraint**: Embedder was always `None` — now correctly passed at init
- **IE embedder API**: Fixed to use `.embed()` method instead of calling embedder directly
- **IE false ABSTAIN**: Fixed false abstain for lowercase proper nouns
- **Agentic search over-retrieval**: Fixed excessive chunk retrieval in single-chunk scenarios

## [0.9.0] - 2026-02-12

### 🎉 Highlights

**KRAG Engine — Sole Engine Architecture** — The Knowledge Routing Augmented Generation (KRAG) engine replaces `fitz_rag` as the only engine. KRAG introduces multi-strategy query routing (code, section, table, chunk), multi-language code extraction (Python, TypeScript, Java, Go), and address-based retrieval with full expansion (references, imports, section context). The `fitz_rag` engine has been deleted entirely — no shims, no compatibility layer.

**Multi-Strategy Query Routing** — Queries are classified by `QueryAnalyzer` into types (code, documentation, data, cross, general) and routed to specialized retrieval strategies with weighted scoring. Each strategy searches a different index (symbol index, section index, table store, chunk store) and results are merged and ranked.

**Retrieval Robustness** — New `min_relevance_score` config field (default 0.15) filters out low-relevance results from vector search, preventing nonsense queries from polluting LLM context. Strategy calls are wrapped in try-except for graceful handling of missing tables on cloud tiers. Connection pool lifecycle management prevents pool exhaustion across tier switches.

### 🚀 Added

#### KRAG Engine (`fitz_sage/engines/fitz_krag/`)
- `FitzKragEngine` — Full `KnowledgeEngine` implementation with multi-strategy retrieval
- `QueryAnalyzer` — LLM-based query classification into code/documentation/data/cross/general types
- `QueryAnalysis` — Frozen dataclass with `strategy_weights` for weighted retrieval routing
- `RetrievalRouter` — Dispatches to code, section, table, chunk strategies and merges results
- `AddressExpander` — Expands retrieved addresses with references, imports, and section context
- `KRAGPipeline` — Full pipeline orchestration (analyze → route → expand → generate)

#### Multi-Language Code Extraction
- `PythonExtractor` — AST-based extraction of classes, functions, imports with relative import resolution
- `TypeScriptExtractor` — TypeScript/JavaScript class, function, interface extraction
- `JavaExtractor` — Java class, method, interface extraction
- `GoExtractor` — Go struct, function, interface extraction
- Symbol index for code-aware retrieval across all supported languages

#### Retrieval Robustness
- `min_relevance_score` config field — Filters addresses below threshold after ranking
- Graceful strategy failure handling — Missing tables/indices log warnings instead of crashing
- `PostgresConnectionManager.close_pool()` — Explicit pool cleanup to prevent connection exhaustion
- Pool cleanup on tier switch in e2e test runner

#### OllamaVision Provider
- `OllamaVision` — Local VLM provider for figure description during ingestion
- VLM parsing integration in KRAG ingestion pipeline

#### Guardrails & Governance Integration
- Guardrails (conflict-aware, insufficient-evidence, causal-attribution) integrated into KRAG
- Cloud cache integration for KRAG pipeline
- Shared detection system (`DetectionOrchestrator`) integrated into KRAG retrieval

### 🔄 Changed

- **Sole engine**: `fitz_krag` is now the only engine — all CLI, runtime, SDK, and API paths updated
- **`fitz init`**: Engine selection removed; KRAG plugin selection integrated
- **DATA query weights**: Rebalanced from `{table: 0.85, section: 0.05}` to `{table: 0.70, section: 0.15}` to prevent document-content queries from being misrouted to table strategy
- **DATA classification prompt**: Sharpened to distinguish explicit tabular operations from questions about facts/specifications that happen to involve numbers
- **pgvector dimension detection**: Now uses `format_type(atttypid, atttypmod)` returning strings like `"vector(384)"` instead of raw integer dimension queries, preventing dimension mismatch across embedding model changes
- **Governance thresholds**: Tuned to s1=0.55, s2=0.79 (15 critical cases)
- **Two-stage classifier**: Added support in eval pipeline
- **Test suite**: Security, chaos, load, and performance tests migrated from fitz_rag to KRAG API

### 🗑️ Removed

#### fitz_rag Engine (replaced by fitz_krag)
- `fitz_sage/engines/fitz_rag/` — Entire engine directory deleted

Trained on 1,113 fitz-gov cases with 51 features. Per-class recall: Abstain 81.2%, Disputed 89.7%, Trustworthy 70.6%. Only 3 dangerous (disputed→trustworthy) errors in 1,100+ cases.

**GovernanceDecider Integration** — New `GovernanceDecider` class wraps the ML classifier with fail-open fallback to `AnswerGovernor`. Loads the model artifact once at init and runs two-stage prediction with calibrated per-class thresholds (s1=0.50, s2=0.785).

**Safety-First Threshold Tuning** — Iterative threshold exploration prioritizing dispute detection safety. Sweet-spot at s2=0.785 balances trustworthy recall (70.6%) against disputed recall (89.7%) with minimal dangerous misclassifications.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-01-24

### 🎉 Highlights

**Unified LLM-Based Query Classification** - Consolidated all scattered query detection systems (temporal, aggregation, comparison, freshness, expansion) into a single unified detection module. One LLM call now classifies all query intents instead of separate regex-based detectors. More accurate classification with lower latency.

### 🚀 Added

#### Unified Detection System (`fitz_sage/retrieval/detection/`)
- `LLMClassifier` - Combines all detection modules into one LLM call
- `DetectionOrchestrator` - Unified registry with `DetectionSummary` result
- `DetectionModule` ABC - Modular detection with `prompt_fragment()` and `parse_result()`
- Detection modules: `TemporalModule`, `AggregationModule`, `ComparisonModule`, `FreshnessModule`, `RewriterModule`
- `ExpansionDetector` - Dict-based synonym/acronym expansion (non-LLM, fast)
- `DetectionResult` dataclass with confidence scores and metadata
- `DetectionCategory` enum for type-safe detection types

### 🔄 Changed

- **Query classification is now LLM-based** - More accurate than regex patterns, handles edge cases better
- **VectorSearchStep** - Now uses `DetectionOrchestrator` for all query classification
- **Retrieval strategies** - Updated to receive `DetectionResult` instead of legacy detector outputs

## [0.6.1] - 2026-01-23

### 🎉 Highlights

**HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings)** - Generate hypothetical document passages that would answer abstract queries, then search with both original and hypothetical embeddings. Bridges the semantic gap between conceptual questions and concrete document content. Queries like "What's their approach to sustainability?" now find relevant EV/battery/emissions docs.

**Contextual Embeddings** - Chunks are now embedded with their summaries prepended, providing richer semantic context. This resolves pronoun ambiguity and improves retrieval quality for chunks that reference concepts without naming them explicitly. Inspired by Anthropic's Contextual Retrieval technique.

**Query Rewriting** - LLM-powered query rewriting resolves conversational context (pronouns, references), fixes typos, removes filler words, and optimizes queries for document retrieval. Enables natural multi-turn conversations with proper context resolution.

**Conversational Context for SDK & API** - The SDK and REST API now support passing conversation history for context-aware retrieval. Queries like "tell me more about it" now work correctly in programmatic use cases.

- **Consistent vector DB interface** - FAISS now implements same admin methods as Qdrant, no backend-specific code needed
- **Generic HTTP vector DB loader** - `GenericVectorDBPlugin` executes YAML specs for any HTTP-based vector DB with support for:
  - All standard operations: `search`, `upsert`, `count`, `create_collection`, `delete_collection`, `list_collections`, `get_collection_stats`
  - Auto-collection creation on 404
  - Point format transformation (standard → provider-specific)
  - UUID conversion for DBs that require it (e.g., Qdrant)
  - Flexible auth (bearer, custom headers, optional)
  - Jinja2 templating for endpoints and request bodies
- **`available_vector_db_plugins()`** - lists all available plugins (both YAML and local)

### 🐛 Fixed
- **FAISS missing interface methods** - Added `list_collections()`, `get_collection_stats()`, `scroll()` to match vector DB contract
- **Rerank mock in tests** - Fixed `MockRerankEngine` to return `List[Tuple[int, float]]` instead of flat list
